                <h2>You Make More Money Than Your Dad—But Feel Broke</h2>
                
                <p>You're making $150K, $200K, maybe more. Your dad worked a factory job and raised three kids on $45K a year.</p>
                
                <p>You're making 4x what he made. And somehow, you have less saved than he did at your age.</p>
                
                <h3>Why this matters:</h3>
                <p>Your income went up, but your identity stayed the same: <strong>"I'm someone who deserves to spend money to feel successful."</strong></p>
                
                <p>You're not broke. You're living out of alignment with who you want to be.</p>
                
                <h3>What it looks like:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>$800/month car lease for a car you barely drive</li>
                    <li>$300/month gym membership you use twice</li>
                    <li>Subscriptions you forgot you have ($47/month adds up)</li>
                    <li>Restaurants, bars, gadgets, stuff that doesn't matter</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>You're not bad with money. You're spending to fill a void.</p>

                <p>Not "stayed up late" tired. Not "had a rough week" tired. Bone-deep, soul-crushing, "I don't remember what energy feels like" tired.</p>
                
                <p>You wake up exhausted. You go to bed exhausted. Coffee doesn't help anymore—it just makes you jittery and exhausted.</p>
                
                <h3>Why this matters:</h3>
                <p>Exhaustion isn't about sleep. It's about identity depletion.</p>
                
                <p>When you spend every day pretending to be someone you're not—performing, pushing, achieving—your nervous system burns out.</p>
                
                <h3>What it looks like:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>7 hours of sleep, but you wake up feeling like you got 4</li>
                    <li>"I'm just getting older" (you're 37)</li>
                    <li>Can't focus in meetings</li>
                    <li>Brain fog by 2 PM every day</li>
                    <li>Weekend doesn't recharge you anymore</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>You're not tired. You're living someone else's life.</p>

                <p>No emergency. No deadline. No boss demanding it. You're just lying in bed at 10:47 PM, scrolling Slack.</p>
                
                <p>Then email. Then LinkedIn. Then back to Slack.</p>
                
                <h3>Why this matters:</h3>
                <p>You believe: <strong>"If I'm not constantly available, I'm not valuable."</strong></p>
                
                <p>That's not professionalism. That's identity crisis.</p>

                    <li>Vacation feels more stressful than work</li>
                    <li>You say "I'm so busy" like it's a flex</li>
                    <li>Sunday night dread starts at 4 PM</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Why this matters:</h3>
                <p>When you're living out of alignment with yourself, your body shuts down everything except survival mode.</p>
                
                <p>Sex requires presence. Playfulness. Connection. And you're too busy performing to be present.</p>

                <h3>Why this matters:</h3>
                <p>You're not recharging. You're recovering.</p>
                
                <p>Because your identity is: <strong>"I work hard, so I deserve to shut down completely."</strong> But you never actually feel rested.</p>

                <h2>You Google "Is This All There Is?" at 2 AM</h2>
                
                <p>You have the job. You have the income. You have the life you worked 15 years to build.</p>
                
                <p>And you're lying awake at 2 AM wondering: <em>Is this it?</em></p>
                
                <h3>Why this matters:</h3>
                <p>You achieved everything you thought would make you happy. And you're not.</p>
                
                <p>Because happiness doesn't come from achievement. It comes from alignment.</p>
                
                <h3>What it looks like:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>"I should be grateful" (but you're not)</li>
                    <li>Look at your LinkedIn and feel nothing</li>
                    <li>Wonder what you're even working toward</li>
                    <li>Can't remember the last time you felt excited about anything</li>
                    <li>Think about quitting, but don't know what else you'd do</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>You're not ungrateful. You're living the wrong life.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3>How Many Applied to You?</h3>
                <p><strong>0-2 signs:</strong> You're probably fine. Keep doing what you're doing.</p>
                <p><strong>3-4 signs:</strong> You're starting to crack. Now's the time to intervene.</p>
                <p><strong>5-7 signs:</strong> You're in the achievement trap. And you need a way out.</p>
            </div>

            <h2 style="font-size: 32px; margin: 60px 0 30px; text-align: center; color: #FFFFFF;">The Pattern You Didn't See</h2>

            <p>All seven signs have one thing in common:</p>

            <p><strong>You built an identity around achievement—and now that identity is killing you.</strong></p>

            <p>You're not broken. You're not lazy. You're not weak.</p>

            <p>You're living out of alignment with who you actually are. And your body, your relationships, your energy—they're all screaming: <em>This isn't you.</em></p>

            <h2 style="font-size: 28px; margin: 50px 0 20px; color: #FFFFFF;">The Identity Shift Solution</h2>

            <p>You don't need another productivity hack. Another morning routine. Another goal-setting framework.</p>

            <p>You need to shift your identity.</p>

            <p>From: <em>I am what I achieve.</em></p>

            <p>To: <strong>I am who I choose to be.</strong></p>

            <p>That shift changes everything.</p>

            <p>After 30 days, most people report:</p>

            <div class="results-grid">
                <div class="result-item">
                    <strong>Better Sleep</strong>

                    <span>Actually recharge</span>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Not because they forced themselves to change. Because they became someone different.</p>

            <h2 style="font-size: 28px; margin: 50px 0 20px; color: #FFFFFF;">Who This Is For</h2>

            <p><strong>This is for you if:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>You recognized yourself in 3+ signs</li>

                <li>You're tired of performing and pretending</li>
                <li>You're ready to become yourself again</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>This is NOT for you if:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>You're happy with your life right now</li>
                <li>You're dealing with a crisis (job loss, health emergency, etc.)</li>
                <li>You're looking for a quick fix</li>
