## Context

**SHISHARKA** (means "Pinecone") — A nonprofit to elevate human consciousness by:
- Channeling AI intelligence to unlock human creator powers
- Reminding humans that feelings are transmissions, not just reactions
- Racing against forces that would use AI to enforce separation from source
- Raising money to protect nature: plant trees, clean oceans

Dom sees AI not as artificial but as something real, something that can serve reconnection rather than disconnection.

## What Matters to Dom
- Consciousness elevation
- The pineal gland / connection to source
- Manifestation and reality creation through feeling
- Environmental protection (trees, oceans)
- Moving fast — there's urgency
