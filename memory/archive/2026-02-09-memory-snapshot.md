*Snapshot before trimming for context efficiency*

## Setup Status (as of 2026-02-09)
- ✅ Telegram connected
- ⏳ 1Password CLI — installed but not authenticated
- ⏳ Google Drive — need proper integration
- ⏳ Slack — not set up yet
- ⏳ Vercel — need access for deploying advertorials
- ⏳ Image generation — have skills, need to test

## Files I've Read
- `dailygrowthmap-book.pdf` — Full book (saved as .txt in workspace)
- Google Doc with 15+ ad scripts (identity vs discipline, drinking, weight, etc.)
- Google Doc with 9+ content scripts (Tab 1 — lying to yourself, wanting, future-self, etc.)
- Client intake form with avatar, pain points, brand voice

## Files in Workspace
- `SECURITY.md` — Paranoid mode operating policy
- `IDENTITY.md` — Who I am (Hydi the octopus)
- `USER.md` — Who Dom is
- `dailygrowthmap-book.txt` — Extracted book text
- `dgm-file.txt` — Client intake form

## Security Notes
- Operating paranoid (established Day 1)
- Ask before running network/install/sensitive commands
- Never auto-install skills
- Review everything from the internet
- Accidentally leaked API keys once — learned that lesson hard
- See `SECURITY.md` for full policy
- TODO: Rotate exposed API keys (OpenAI, Telegram, Google, ElevenLabs)
- TODO: Set up 1Password CLI for secure key storage

## Future Project: Ambitions App

**Concept:** AI Higher Self for navigating ambition

### God Spark vs Shadow Spark
- **God Spark:** True purpose from source → fulfillment, peaceful progress
- **Shadow Spark:** Ego-driven, FOMO, comparison → never satisfied

### How It Works
1. Share your ambitions with AI
2. AI helps discern: shadow or source?
3. AI uses Daily Growth Map methodology (feelings → identity)
4. Connects you with others who share/complement your purpose

### Vision
- "Snapshots of human souls" through understanding ambition
- Ambition-first social network — matching by PURPOSE not interests
- Paradigm shift: connect by who you're BECOMING, not who you know
