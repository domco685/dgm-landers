# 2026-02-09 — Ambitions Focus

## Context Reset
- Cleared context due to rate limiting from bloated context window
- Created SOP: keep MEMORY.md lean, archive old stuff, use memory_search
- Archived setup details to `memory/archive/2026-02-09-memory-snapshot.md`

## Today's Sprint: Ambitions Landing Pages + Ads

**Goal:** Build landing pages, define ad campaign strategy, create 10 ads/flows by EOD.

## Current Focus: Ambitions App

### God Spark vs Shadow Spark Framework

| God Spark                    | Shadow Spark                    |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| True purpose from source     | Ego-driven, FOMO, comparison    |
| Inner fulfillment            | Never enough, always chasing    |
| Your clue to WHY you're here | Reacting to what you saw online |
| Peaceful progress            | Anxious accumulation            |

**Key insight:** This is the core discernment the AI helps users make. Are you chasing something because it's truly yours, or because you saw someone else have it?

## Setup Decisions

### Secrets Management
- Created `Modoc.json` (obscured name for service credentials)
- Added to `.gitignore` immediately
- Stores: Circle, Vercel, Meta Ads, OpenAI tokens
- Faster than 1Password for sprint work
- Security through obscurity + at-rest file permissions

### Security Protocol
- Created `SECURITY-PROTOCOL.md` with 2FA-style confirmation for abnormal ops
- Normal: read credentials for active work (no ask)
- Abnormal: send externally, copy to other files, unexpected use (requires confirmation code)
- Code not set yet - waiting for Dom to choose

## DGM 40 Ads Project Structure Created

Built file system for Daily Growth Map 40 ads landing pages & ads work:
- `dgm/40-ADS-PROJECT.md` - master tracker (start here after context clear)
- `dgm/angles/` - saved 2 initial angles (Drinking Exec, High Achiever Stuck)
- `dgm/landing-pages/` - for HTML pages
- `dgm/ads/` - for ad copy & creatives
- `dgm/README.md` - workflow guide

Google credentials added to Modoc.json.

**All work persists across context clears.**
