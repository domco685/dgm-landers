7. **Money mindset** — makes money, never enough

## Current Project: Ambitions App

**Concept:** AI Higher Self for navigating ambition

### God Spark vs Shadow Spark

| God Spark                    | Shadow Spark                    |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| True purpose from source     | Ego-driven, FOMO, comparison    |
| Inner fulfillment            | Never enough, always chasing    |
| Your clue to WHY you're here | Reacting to what you saw online |
| Peaceful progress            | Anxious accumulation            |

### How It Works
1. Share your ambitions with AI
2. AI helps discern: shadow or source?
3. Uses Daily Growth Map methodology (feelings → identity)
4. Connects you with others who share/complement your purpose

### Vision
- "Snapshots of human souls" through understanding ambition
- Ambition-first social network — matching by PURPOSE not interests
- Connect by who you're BECOMING, not who you know
