This book is about being a curious student of life and
learning how to create your reality through feelings
and imagination, of all things!
Creating it was my way to improving my mastery of
manifestation. That said, I’m still a curious student
and will always remain one, just one who is able to
teach the basics here as I advance my practice.
I expect that you will be a curious student, who soon
realizes this power and will then be able to teach as
a way to build upon your mastery…and so on.
As such, this book is…

Dedicated to you… your Growth – and those
you’ll help Grow.
I’m thrilled to have you join me so we can learn and

WTF IS THIS BOOK?
​
First things first: I'm not a guru and don't aspire to be one - just a
curious student of life, sharing a powerful framework, carefully crafted
around the principles of my transformation.
Will it work for you? “YES! YES! YES!” is my true belief. Otherwise,
I wouldn’t have put so much into it. But, you still have to commit and
believe. Spend 3-minutes a day for a few weeks and the “Golden
Threads” will start to appear. Worst case: less doomscrolling at night.
Why listen to me? In about a year, using this exact method, I
dropped a 20-year drinking habit, lost 80+ pounds, dramatically
improved my health, saved over a million dollars, advanced my
career, abolished anger and resentment and started exciting new
businesses aligned with my soul’s purpose - all through manifesting
a new identity.
The secret? Feelings + Action. Feelings? Yes, those things we're
often conditioned to ignore or suppress. Realizing my feelings were
the language to program my subconscious unlocked my ability to
intentionally shape my reality through imagination and take aligned
actions. In less than 30 days, you too will be able to generate
feelings mapped to your desired outcomes, so you can go from
Imagination to Aligned Action to New Reality.
Ignore this power, and you'll still create your reality - but unknowingly
and not the one you want, leaving you a Victim vs. a powerful Creator.
This isn't about manifesting fancy objects (too narrow-minded). It's
about manifesting identity and character. Becoming the person who
embodies the traits associated with the outcomes you want. All those
fancy things will effortlessly come to you then - if you still even want
them; it’s undeniable you’ll attract whatever you “want” if you become
the being who can control their feelings + actions.
See you inside ~ DOM

LET’S TALK “FEELINGS”
As a guy approaching 40, I grew up in a world where “feelings”
were not something that were openly discussed or encouraged,
actually the opposite. They were associated with weakness and
being too feminine. As a result, I learned to avoid them by
distracting myself with obsessive work, fancy objects and
women who temporarily boosted my ego. I even learned how to
use alcohol and drugs to change my bad feelings into
temporary bliss, only to be emotionally bankrupt later.
But…Feeling is the Secret! It’s also the name of a profound
piece of work written by Neville Goddard. In his 33 short, but
dense and powerful pages, he explains that FEELINGS ARE
THE ONLY LANGUAGE THAT YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS MIND
UNDERSTANDS and therefore the method in which we can
communicate with the subconscious mind and create whatever
reality we want. What does this even mean?
For a moment, consider the possibility that your life’s story is
written by your imagination and feelings. Meaning that if you
can transform your wishes into feelings, as if they are already
true, through intense visualization, and fully believe the desired
outcome is true until it feels vividly real, you will manifest that
outcome (new reality). “Sensation precedes manifestation
and is the foundation upon which all manifestation rests.”
~ Neville
No way. How? Once that feeling is deeply planted in your
subconscious, it will pick-up and work with your conscious mind
to develop the beliefs that drive your identity (meaning your
operating system changes, you “become” the person that
believes you have the outcome and you become capable of
attracting that outcome.) The best way to plant this feeling is
through sleep and prayer, these moments are gateways into
your subconscious. Not in a religious way. I avoided “Prayer”
nearly my whole life, associating it with a Christian thing.
Prayer is not religious. A prayer is just a container to develop a
5

feeling and communicate it to the universe; an ‘art of assuming
of being and having that which you want.’
You can now see that if feelings are this powerful, you must
then choose your feelings carefully. Negative feelings drive
negative outcomes, and positive feelings drive positive
outcomes. Your subconscious shapes reality from your
strongest feelings; the strongest, repeated feelings dictate your
outcomes. Feelings are “tools” that establish your self-belief
and create your reality. Gaining control over feelings, (shifting
negative feelings into positive beliefs) powers your
manifestations: “Control of feeling is all important to a full
and happy life... Mastery of self-control of your thoughts
and feelings is your highest achievement.” ~ Neville
“Control feelings” doesn’t mean to avoid, dismiss or bury
negative feelings, rather swiftly address those head-on and
course correct by immediately redirecting your attention and
feelings toward positivity, empowerment and the assumption of
your desired reality.
Continuously live as if you already are the person you aspire to
become, and you will become it. This is all very similar to Joe
Dispenza’s mantra that ‘what you believe you become’ because
the best way to believe something, is to “feel” it.
But…How do you possibly control your feelings?
This was where I was stuck for months. So I developed a
framework that helps me really get in touch with what I’m
feeling and shift those feelings to my benefit; making me the
creator vs. a victim. Memorize this framework for your daily
journaling when you’re prompted to connect with how the
outcome of what you want feels (step 3).
It’s called: ASKING
It’s simple. You use inquiry to manufacture a structured feeling
that is mapped to your desired outcome. Once you have it, you
can generate the outcome. And if you’re feeling down or
negative (in contradiction to your desired outcome), you can
6

use this too to reconcile and adjust your feelings (or as Neville
would say “control” feeling).
A

Awareness

How can you articulate the feeling that would
map to your desired outcome? Why?

S

Sensations

What happens in your physical body with this
feeling? How can you trigger those?

K

Knowing

Do you know you’re capable of this feeling?
Have you felt it before?

I

Imagine

What is the visualization that comes to mind
when you feel this?

N

Nurture

Can you prevent the ego from pulling back to
safety by expanding space for the feeling?

G

Generate

Can you feel it so deeply you’ve established a
belief of realness?

FEELING IS THE SECRET! You manifest what you feel and believe
yourself to be. Feelings ➜ Beliefs ➜ Identity ➜ Outcomes
(The practice in this book is to first manifest the identity through
feelings, which attracts additional desired outcomes in your vision)

A powerful affirmation to establish feelings quickly “I AM” which
acts almost like a shortcut and encompasses A.S.K.I.N.G.:
THE I AM AFFIRMATION:
The only affirmation I believe in is “I AM” which uses powerful declarations
of self-identity ("I AM...") to directly program your subconscious mind and
shape your self-concept. When you declare something after "I AM," you're
affirming an identity, creating a blueprint that your subconscious then
works to realize. This must be matched with the corresponding feeling to
hold weight.

MY STORY
This program isn’t at all about drinking, nor is it a program aimed to replace traditional recovery. But,
manifestation was the cornerstone for me overcoming my dependency on alcohol. I include this as a
useful reference to anyone who faces similar challenges because I fundamentally believe alcohol
and other lower vibrational drugs prevent powerful manifestation, they disable your ability to master
your feelings. Otherwise, just healing for me to share my path, as vulnerable as it is.

When I was in my late teens and early 20s, I had a drinking
problem. I was constantly in trouble with the law, I was
frequently in car accidents, fights, cheating, etc. But by my late
20s, I had things under control. “I no longer have a drinking
problem” I would tell myself. “What a master I am” - my ego
would purr. Throughout my 30s, that mindset stuck. I was
continually more successful in my career, I was advancing my
life, etc. etc. What could be wrong?
I wasn’t really being honest with myself. I had a lot of problems,
and most of those problems were from drinking:
●​
●​
●​
●​

I weighed 275+ lbs and had high blood pressure / sugar.
I frequently had bronchitis from smoking cigs when drinking.
I never seemed to have enough money, despite making a lot.
I couldn’t keep a romantic relationship in a healthy state due
to insecurity and attachment issues, or “chasing next”.
●​ I would have blowout anger-ridden fights with my parents.
●​ I found myself getting incredibly angry at small things, like
shaking and yelling and even getting into arguments with
airport security etc. How embarrassing :)

In fact, the only thing that was going well for me was my career.
And probably that could have been better too considering many
of my friends have 5x net worth as me.
And then it dawned on me. My life was just “sustainable” that’s not a good thing, despite having that be the goal of all our
eco-conscious group-think. A great quote from Cradle to Cradle
is: “If I were to ask you how your relationship was going, and
you were to answer, ‘oh, you know, it’s sustainable,’ I would feel
quite bad for you.”
Yet, that was where I was at. My life was sustainable. And
probably not for long. And I felt quite bad for myself.

THIS WAS NOT THE LIFE I WANTED. Something had to give,
I deep down knew it was the alcohol and I tried everything:
●​ I went to AA despite not believing in God or feeling like my
problem was that severe - I quit.
●​ I paid thousands for “control coaching programs” which were
great but I kept drinking and didn’t finish.
●​ I made myself rules like “Tequila only” to get slimmer, but
ended up drinking beers after a few tequilas ;)

I gave up. I lost trust in myself. But then a window opened up. I
somehow got enough motivation to start listening to my
SupraHuman fitness coach Jared and just really track macros.
Alcohol had no place. I cared enough about getting fit and
being attractive to temporarily give it up. It was just enough of a
“not-drinking window” to end up going to this spiritual
entrepreneurs retreat in Costa Rica that I had for some reason
signed up for 6 months ago, despite not knowing anything
about spirituality, or really having an interest. The event by
Coherence Events was amazing, and very uncomfortable. I
was pretty much the only guy and had no idea what was going
on. I decided to stick around in Costa Rica and because I had
been listening to Aubrey Marcus that year, I’d grown curious
about Ayahuasca and it’s potential healing properties.
I cautiously found my way into the care of a Shaman who did a
solo ceremony with me. The experience was totally ineffable
and life changing. I’ll go into depth in some video, but in short I
became a believer in God and the source of life; still not
religious, but very clearly now know and have faith there is
WAY MORE THAN MEETS THE EYE since I’ve experienced
other dimensions. Everything was shown to me and my
higher-self carefully “woke me up” to show me my power. And I
was done with drinking. How could I have ever done that to
myself? Plant medicine is magic. Wow. That was easy.
And a month later…I was drinking beers in the morning on
Saturday. How could this happen? Wasn’t I ‘cured’? Wasn’t the
Ayahuasca a healing magic power? I felt lower than ever.
But something was very different this time…
9

I started to get hangovers. Not just physical ones, emotional
ones. Now that I knew I wasn’t just a human victim, that I was
this infinite powerful being that incarnated in this human body
by choice, that I “get to be here” - The drinking was hard on
me. Why am I handicapping myself? But what can I do? I still
physically crave it. Shit.
One day while listening to John Madsen (SupraHuman) he
mentioned this book "Feeling is the Secret" by Neville Goddard
and that “feelings create reality.” I bought the book on the spot.
I didn’t read it for months, and then read it and was
fascinated… but didn’t know what to make of it. I mean this
dude was talking about how your “feelings impregnate your
subconscious womb and manifest your desired outcomes.”
WTF right? That was so “woo-woo” I was embarrassed to even
tell my girlfriend that I owned the book.
But his nighttime practice (which this program is based on)
stuck in my mind. And each night I would feel the outcome I
wanted and go to sleep. Then I started to journal around it. And
it started to work. I read it again, and again. I listened to it; to
everything he said.
Three months later, one Sunday AM, I was drinking a beer in
bed and something clicked. I drink because I can’t control
my feelings. It’s my attempt to control them, but they are all
over the place. No wonder my life isn’t what I want it to be, my
subconscious must be terribly confused and therefore my
reality is confused. I literally laughed out loud. I figured it out. I
continued to drink that day, but that night I went to bed feeling
the outcome I wanted: To not need alcohol to control my
feelings. I woke up with a violent cough and choked out loud
“OK. I get it. I’m done.” I’ve never had a drink since, nor really a
desire. I manifested my power over alcohol with feelings.
I believe so much in the power of manifestation, have so much
faith, that I can’t let alcohol get in the way of my feelings,
because then I won’t be the Creator of my reality.

HOW THIS WORKS
This program is a combination of several media types:
●​ A printed journal (we offset printing by planting a tree)
●​ An online course (linked with QR codes)
●​ An AI sidekick (evolving GPT)
Together these mediums compound and reinforce the content’s
impact. The goal is to make manifesting identity and character
first-nature (able to be done mentally in minutes each day), but
you may like to continue with any of them – I still use the AI
everyday, and journal often. I often scan journals into the AI,
which I encourage you to do as well.

You can access the Full Training by
scanning this QR Code. The videos will
guide you through how to set up your
custom AI DAILY GROWTH MAP coach.

Each section deep links to the specific video too. At the end of
the month, your subconscious will be working with your
conscious mind AND you’ll have an AI that is tuned into to
support your ability to manifest. PRETTY WILD!!!
Intentionally, this book isn’t full of testimonials nor proof, the
simple challenge is for the reader to implement in
3-minutes-per-day and experience the power their way.
FWIW, as much as I use AI…95% of this book was not created
with AI. It’s very human, intentionally. I think that’s important to
call out because “feelings are human” - we get to keep that.

DAILY​
PRACTICE
​
This practice is the most important part of the program–the
foundation. You’ll build this habit over this month and it will
become first-nature to you. If you’re not familiar with the
concept of manifestation and universal law of attraction, it can
be distilled to: embody that which you seek and you’ll
attract it. Simple, but hard to believe in. And, often attached to
a host of “angel numbers” and “portals” and “chants” etc. Too
woo for most action-oriented people.
I’ve stripped away all that doesn’t serve folks who aren’t looking
to get into a spiritual thing at this time and built the program
around taking action vs. just making affirmations/orders to the
universe. There are zero religious affiliations or suggestions
here, nor am I associated with any religious organization.
I discovered the basis for this practice in Neville Goddard’s
concise manifestation manual, Feeling is the Secret1. His 33
pages changed my life forever. The teachings, while direct, are
abstract to put into practice. They weren’t directed towards an
action-oriented, Type-A entrepreneur like myself. It took me
nearly 6 months to really understand WTF he was talking
about. Once I did, I literally sat up in bed, while drinking a beer,
and laughed out loud; everything changed - I never had
another drink of alcohol after that moment. It was at that
moment I knew I had to advance his work; make it mainstream
by creating a gateway practice. My work has built on his, and
contains more, but still simple and easy to commit to. Enjoy.

THE THREE 1-MINUTE PARTS:
The practice for each day actually starts the night before. This
is very important so we get our subconscious working for us:

1) BEDTIME GENERATION (1 minute)
Right before bed, after your phone is asleep and the TV is off,
imagine your desired outcome and deeply feel the sensations
of what having that outcome is like as you breathe and fall
asleep. This is your inner conversation. And you’re setting it
to this “TAKEAWAY FEELING” that you carry into your dreams
to program your subconscious mind during your sleep.

2) MORNING GENERATION (1 minute)
When you wake up, before reaching for your phone, check-in
with your “TAKEAWAY FEELING” from the night before and try
to recall your dreams and how they relate to it. Quickly
document them in your journal or by taking an audio recording.
Then commit to revisit your “TAKEAWAY FEELING” throughout
the day a few times (#3 below).

3) REFLECTION + BELIEF OS (1 minute)
Throughout the day take mental note actions where you are
creating your “TAKEAWAY FEELING” to arise. Also, note when
beliefs are in conflict and try to reframe those beliefs with
feelings and actions that will instead support your “TAKEAWAY
FEELING” (for example, find PROOF points that the new
identity is manifesting). This is like calibrating your mind during
the day. This is similar to a quick gratitude exercise, or prayer if
you’re familiar.

13

A few simple examples of how the journal will function:

Manifesting in your Career
Bedtime: I want to win exec approval for my big pitch, I

need to radiate conviction for the opportunity I see but I’m
anxious, so I “feel” the excitement of others in the room.

Morning: In my dreams I was seeing big waves – that could
mean fear. I need to address that head-on by feeling the
excitement others will have with my ideas.

Reflection: How did that fear show up? Could I meet it with

anticipation from others? Did this help me act accordingly?

Notes: Notice the shift from “wanting” to win approval to
helping others “feel excited” about an opportunity you came
up with. It will radiate.

Manifesting for your Weight Loss
Bedtime: I want to lose 50-lbs by summer, I need to adhere
to a calorie deficit but I always fail, so I need to “feel”
what it’s like to take my shirt off by the pool with no
shame.

Morning: I dreamt of cheeseburgers – that could mean

temptation is strong and willpower is weak. I need to face
temptation with feeling great in my skin.

Reflection: How did temptation show up? Could I meet it with
how great I feel this summer? Did this help me take healthy
actions?

Notes: Notice the shift from “missing out” on crappy food to
“gaining” a feeling of pride around your body.

These are quick and simple examples, but what’s happening here is
almost a Jedi mind-trick, using “feelings of the outcome” to program
your subconscious to build an identity that acts in alignment with the
desired outcome.

KICKOFF​
WORK
​
Before starting this practice, we want to go through several
steps to create our vision of what we’re manifesting. These are
important to follow because everything builds off this vision.
Then, the DAILY work actually is this in short form. And after
doing the DAILY work for about a month, you’ll reflect on this to
see how much has changed.

PAINT YOUR
MASTERPIECE
Imagine if you had the ability to paint your own life? You do!
You just imagined it, that makes it real enough to create. That’s
what this visualization exercise is about. It’s critical to start with
the “Painted Picture” so you’re able to later build an identity to
pursue that picture, and generate it daily to create it.
Develop your Masterpiece by documenting your vision in the
areas that resonate the most with you (use as few or as many
as you like, more will give you fuller generative material to work
with during the program).

BUILD YOUR​
IDENTITY
​
We need to carefully construct your “Being” – the person you
need to be in order to express your masterpiece into reality. An
excellent deep dive on this is in the book THE ALTER EGO
EFFECT by Todd Herman2. He has worked with countless
performers and athletes to develop a high performance identity
(ex: Kobe Bryant and the famous Black Mamba identity). The
quick summary below is loosely based on his book, but for the
purposes of this practice only. In no way does it do justice to his
work. I highly recommend buying his book (see footnote) or
doing a workshop with him.
An Alter Ego is a carefully constructed identity designed to help
you access your best self in specific situations. It acts as a
mental shortcut to embody the traits, behaviors, and mindset
necessary to achieve your goals. Todd Herman’s work
emphasizes using the Alter Ego as a tool to overcome
self-doubt, distractions, or negative patterns by stepping into a
persona that embodies confidence, focus, and the attributes
you aspire to.

The most impactful quote from the book for me is:​
“The Alter Ego method is about strategically using
imagination to change how you show up in your world.”

See…imagination again. It’s so powerful.

2

“The Alter Ego Effect” by Todd Herman (QR code in “Resources”)
19

The process involves:
1.​ Identify the specific challenge or context where you feel
stuck or limited.
2.​ Define the qualities and traits required to succeed in this
situation.
3.​ Choose role models or examples who embody these desired
characteristics.
4.​ Craft a persona (Alter Ego) by combining these chosen traits
and role-model inspiration.
5.​ Activate your Alter Ego using symbols or totems, such as
clothing, accessories, rituals, or mantras.

20

IDENTITY BUILDING EXERCISE
The key here is to create an identity capable of expressing your
Masterpiece in the previous exercise.
1. DEFINE THE CHALLENGE: What area of your life are
you struggling with or want to elevate? (e.g., getting in
shape, drinking too much, confidence in social settings)

2. IMAGINE YOURSELF IN THAT CONTEXT: If you were
already excelling in this area, what qualities or traits would
you embody? List specific characteristics (e.g., disciplined,
charismatic, resilient) and actions to take.

3. IDENTIFY ROLE MODELS & INSPIRATION: Who
inspires you and why? (These could be real people, fictional
characters, or even animals.) What traits do they have that
you admire?

21

4. CREATE THE PERSONA: Combine the traits you
identified into a persona. Give your alter ego a name that
feels powerful and meaningful to you. Describe what this
identity looks like, sounds like, and how they behave.

5. CHOOSE YOUR TOTEM (ACTIVATION TOOL): What
physical item, piece of clothing, or ritual can you use to
"activate" this new identity? (Examples: necklace, a specific
jacket, a wristband, or a mantra.)

6. SET THE SCENE: Visualize yourself stepping into your
alter ego. Write a scene where you face a challenge while
fully embodying this persona. How does it feel? How do you
act? What’s the result?

REFRAME​
YOUR BELIEFS
Your beliefs are the subconscious operating system that shape
your reality. Let’s begin by identifying limiting beliefs: those
ideas that hold you back or restrict your potential. Once
uncovered, we’ll replace them with empowering, positive beliefs
that align with the life you want to create. This is just the
starting point; your belief system can evolve and expand over
time.
Examples of Limiting Beliefs to get you started:
​

Health & Body
●​
●​

“I’m just not a disciplined person; healthy routines never stick for
me.”
“Everyone in my family has heart issues, so it’s only a matter of time
for me.”

Career & Money
●​
●​

“I’m not ‘technical enough’ to succeed in AI or software, so why try?”
“Making a lot of money means sacrificing my values or free time.”

Relationships & Love
●​

“The passionate spark always fades—long‑term partners inevitably
grow apart.”

●​ “I attract partners who need fixing; healthy people wouldn’t choose
me.”​

25

Creativity & Self‑Expression
●​
●​

“Everything worth inventing is already being done by someone with
more resources.”
“If my first public launch flops, I’ll be branded a failure and lose
credibility.”

Personal Worth & Identity
●​
●​

“Unless I’m constantly productive, I don’t deserve relaxation or joy.”
“I’ve made too many mistakes in the past to become the kind of
person I admire.”

Time, Age & Opportunity
●​

●​

“If I haven’t nailed my life purpose by now, I probably never will.”
“Opportunities like that only come to people who started earlier than
I did.”​

Change, Risk & Failure
●​

“If I pivot again, everyone will think I’m flaky and unemployable.”

●​ “One wrong move could ruin the progress I’ve made, so better to
stay put.”​

Community & Impact
●​

“I need a massive following before I can help anyone meaningfully.”

●​ “Unless my idea changes the world, it’s not worth pursuing.”

GRANT YOURSELF
PERMISSION
Beyond limiting beliefs, many of us subconsciously hold
ourselves back from winning big. This is a deeper operating
flaw in our mindset. Shift to the belief, “If not me, then who? If
not now, then when?” and visualize yourself achieving your
greatest wins.
●​ Step 1: Write down your top 3 Big Wins and why you
deserve them.
●​ Step 2: Close your eyes and immerse yourself in the feeling
of winning 1 full minute. Use A.S.K.I.N.G. method (page 7).
●​ Step 3: When you’ve locked in those feelings, check the
box: PERMISSION GRANTED.
Checking the box might feel small, but it’s a powerful act of mentally
recording this moment of your permission to self.

DAILY PRACTICE
Now that you’ve established such a strong base by Painting
your Masterpiece, built a new Identity around it, become aware
of your core Limiting Beliefs and how to reframe them and
prove those reframes with synchronicities, you have given
yourself permission to become a powerful manifestor. You are
ready to start the daily practice. You can refer back to your
Masterpiece to find Desired Outcomes you want to manifest,
pick one per week, or just keep advancing the most important
one. Remember you’re changing identity, which is hard.

Principles to Remember:
Show up
daily

3 Minutes, every day.
Consistency over
intensity.

Repetition wires the habit into
long‑term memory and keeps
the identity top‑of‑mind.

Be all
here

Phone face‑down, no
multitasking.

Attention is the currency your
subconscious accepts; split it
and the deposit bounces.

Feel it
for real

Let the “future‑you”
feeling flood your
body.

Emotion is the signal that tells
your nervous system, “Store
this as real.”

Speak it
out

Share goals with a
trusted friend.

Saying it aloud adds social
proof and mild accountability
pressure.

Spot
Quiet
wins

Look for subtle shifts:
mood, posture, small
decisions.

Early gains are internal;
noticing them keeps
motivation alive.

33

WEEK 1
MASTERPIECE: What outcome from your masterpiece
are you manifesting this week? Pick a specific Focus Area.

How close are you today to having this Masterpiece: 0 / 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 / 5

Why does it matter to you?

What actions are in-alignment?

What actions are out-of-alignment?

34

DAILY PRACTICE:​
WEEK 1, DAY 1/7
​

BEDTIME GENERATION
Triggering the feeling of your desired outcome right before sleep is the best way to
program our subconscious mind, which communicates with our conscious mind
while we sleep and helps us build identity to take aligned action the following day.

​ PUT AWAY YOUR PHONE

What is the OUTCOME YOU WANT and WHY?
Be concrete and specific about why this ‘outcome’ will be a major unlock for you.

Who do you NEED TO BE?
Define the ‘characteristics’ and ‘actions’ of the being deserving of this outcome?

Imagine how IT FEELS?
Close your eyes and deeply feel all the sensations these outcomes create in you.
Use the A.S.K.I.N.G. METHOD from Page 7 (Let’s Talk About Feelings).

​
LATER REFERRED TO AS: YOUR “TAKEAWAY FEELING”
DEEPEN THE BELIEF IN YOUR TAKEAWAY FEELING BY NURTURING
YOUR IMAGINATION TO GENERATE INTENSE VISUALS AND BODY
SENSATIONS AS YOU DRIFT TO SLEEP WITH DEEP BREATH.

Suggested Deep Sleep Breath: Slow inhale [hold for 4 seconds], slow
release [hold for 4+ seconds]. Repeat as you fall asleep.
35

MORNING GENERATION
Before distracting the mind with your phone, try to recall your dreams and see
how they connect to last night’s generation.

DREAM RECALL:
If you remember your dreams, how did your TAKEAWAY FEELING appear, if at all?

TODAY’S ALIGNED ACTIONS:
To reinforce the sensations of your TAKEAWAY FEELING, what will you commit to?

​ SAY AND BELIEVE THE “I AM” AFFIRMATION (I AM: New Identity)
Now is a great time to lock in with a short meditation to prime your mind, before
distracting it with your devices and hectic schedule (more info in videos).

EVENING REFLECTION
What BELIEFS do you need to REFRAME?
Were there limiting beliefs today that were in opposition to your TAKEAWAY FEELING?
We want to abandon these by challenging their truth.

Where did you observe UNIVERSAL PROOFS?
Were there synchronicities (little magic moments) that were affirmations of your
TAKEAWAY FEELING. We want to recognize these confirmations and reinforce them.

REFLECTION:​
WEEK 1
Let’s summarize the work we did to take forward to the following
week. It’s important to be honest. No change is acceptable!

MASTERPIECE: What outcome were you manifesting?

WHY: How does your life improve as this manifests?

HOW MUCH CLOSER ARE YOU?

START END

What reflections lead to your change in score? (ex: what
actions started to become more effortless, if any).

Enter
Starting
Score
Here
(0-5)

Enter

Score
Here
(0-5)

We don’t expect this “masterpiece” to manifest in a week ;)
But we do expect that there are mindset shifts happening to identity to
“embed” the order and make it easier to attract.
49

Let’s identify patterns that arose during this week to advance
understanding of your Being.

OUTCOME PATTERNS:
How did the outcome shift, or advance? Why does that matter?

IDENTITY PATTERNS:
How did your identity shift, or advance? Why does that matter?

FEELING PATTERNS:
How did your feelings shift, or advance? Why does that matter?

DREAM PATTERNS:
How did your dreams shift, or advance? Why does that matter?

ACTION PATTERNS:
How did your actions shift, or advance? Why does this matter?

Be concrete and specific about why this ‘outcome’ will be a major unlock for you.

Who do you NEED TO BE?
Define the ‘characteristics’ and ‘actions’ of the being deserving of this outcome?

Imagine how IT FEELS?
Close your eyes and deeply feel all the sensations these outcomes create in you.​

MORNING GENERATION
Before distracting the mind with your phone, try to recall your dreams and see
how they connect to last night’s generation.

DREAM RECALL:
If you remember your dreams, how did your TAKEAWAY FEELING appear, if at all?

TODAY’S ALIGNED ACTIONS:
To reinforce the sensations of your TAKEAWAY FEELING, what will you commit to?

​ SAY AND BELIEVE THE “I AM” AFFIRMATION (I AM: New Identity)
Now is a great time to lock in with a short meditation to prime your mind, before
distracting it with your devices and hectic schedule (more info in videos).

EVENING REFLECTION
What BELIEFS do you need to REFRAME?
Were there limiting beliefs today that were in opposition to your TAKEAWAY FEELING?
We want to abandon these by challenging their truth.

Where did you observe UNIVERSAL PROOFS?
Were there synchronicities (little magic moments) that were affirmations of your
TAKEAWAY FEELING. We want to recognize these confirmations and reinforce them.

BEDTIME GENERATION
Triggering the feeling of your desired outcome right before sleep is the best way to
program our subconscious mind, which communicates with our conscious mind
while we sleep and helps us build identity to take aligned action the following day.

REFLECTION:​
WEEK 4
Let’s summarize the work we did to take forward to the following
week. It’s important to be honest. No change is acceptable!

MASTERPIECE: What outcome were you manifesting?

WHY: How does your life improve as this manifests?

HOW MUCH CLOSER ARE YOU?

START END

What reflections lead to your change in score? (ex: what
actions started to become more effortless, if any).

We don’t expect this “masterpiece” to manifest in a week ;)
But we do expect that there are mindset shifts happening to identity to
“embed” the order and make it easier to attract.

103

Let’s identify patterns that arose during this week to advance
understanding of your Being.

OUTCOME PATTERNS:
How did the outcome shift, or advance? Why does that matter?

IDENTITY PATTERNS:
How did your identity shift, or advance? Why does that matter?

FEELING PATTERNS:
How did your feelings shift, or advance? Why does that matter?

DREAM PATTERNS:
How did your dreams shift, or advance? Why does that matter?

ACTION PATTERNS:
How did your actions shift, or advance? Why does this matter?

MONTH END​
REFLECTION
​
​
The time has finally come to take a reflective look at all of your
progress and examine your GROWTH MAP. You can look back at
where you started and see where you’re at now.

IDENTITY SHIFT:
How has your Being changed during the course of the program?

ACTIONS SHIFT:
What actions are now part of your Being’s regular character that weren’t before?

BELIEFS SHIFT:
Looking back at your limiting beliefs, which ones are no longer with you? What have
they been replaced by?

MANIFESTATIONS:
What have you been able to call in and attract into your life? Have your outcomes and
desires shifted at all or reprioritized?

105

INTEGRATION & NEXT STEPS
​
You just made a major accomplishment by making it this far
(assuming you did the work and didn’t skip to this page!) The
first step is just to pause for a moment and reflect on your
new found human power. How does it feel?
Next, I’ve created a library of DEEPER INTEGRATIONS that
you can use to support yourself and others.
A few of the topics:
●​ Leverage AI to support your manifestations
●​ How to not avoid feelings in the wild
●​ Accepting meditation and prayer
●​ Eliminating alcohol
●​ Introducing plant medicine
●​ Forgiving parents
●​ Getting fit
●​ Growing money
●​ And, GOODBYE CHASING!
More will come over time on the channels, hopefully from
members just like you too!

MY BELIEF SYSTEM…
I would regret putting this entire work together and not going
deeper on my spiritual belief system; so much of my new-found
power is rooted in this discovery and it may help guide others.
I did put this at the end of the book for two reasons:
1.​ DAILY GROWTH MAP could be highly impactful for
many people who may be turned off by this section, I
didn’t want them to lose the benefit early. This practice
works even without deep spiritual beliefs.
2.​ I think many of the people who would have rejected any
spiritual discussion in the beginning may be more
open-minded after realizing some personal successes,
and perhaps this work is a gateway to spirituality.
This is the most and only woo-woo part of this book :) IT IS
NOT RELIGIOUS. You can skip it if you have an allergic
reaction to this topic. But...everything that has unfolded in
my life recently is powered by my ever-deepening
connection to God/Source/Universe. It is an absolute
amplifier effect beyond belief, built on belief. If this speaks
to you, even if only in curiosity, keep reading – it’s meant for
you.
Why does manifestation, as we learned in the DAILY GROWTH
MAP, work? In a simple capacity: Our reality is what we
perceive it to be. If we modify the person who is observing, the
outcome varies since the lens has changed. With manifesting
identity, we modify that person through “Feelings” into a new
being. So by working with feelings, we’re able to shift reality by
attracting new outcomes into it.
On a deeper level, I believe manifestation works because it ties
to the Spiritual power that is manifested in us Humans. Neville
Goddard also believed this in some ways. There is no “right
view” and mine will constantly evolve, but my hypothesis is that
manifestation works better as you improve your relationship to
your higher-self by earning trust as you work along a shared
107

mission. I believe this because I had a spiritual download
explaining it. Since that point, the degree of conviction I have in
myself and in my existence is untouched and unshakeable. It
has been a step level experience, with no ayahuasca or
meditation etc.
I was sitting in a Kombucha bar called Gratitude (Colorado
Springs) and I sat down with a journal to write out my action
steps for my “real career” the next day. Before I knew it, I was
writing a prose-like structure explaining this all to me.
Here it is:
Mysterious Human Power (what I refer to as SHISHARKA)
Your way is power. My way is power. Our way is power.
Your power – Your way. Our power – Our way.
Our power is undeniable.
Unrecognizable most of the time; hidden in plain sight.
So obvious… it’s forgotten.
That is the nature of this power.
It need not be established or recognized to prevail.
It supports through love and energy, moving all of us creatures
through this cosmic journey.
What is this “power” I speak of?
It is not control, not politics, nor manipulation.
It is affirmation in its essence.
We are the prize. We are Divine.
To breathe is to be Divine.
To touch, to feel, to create, to reproduce—and most importantly,
to simply be—is Divine.
And therefore… I need none of your power for mine.
Your power need not recognize my power for mine to exist.
108

And that is to be full.
To understand that you need nothing more than your own
divine Human Power.
Once we come to believe that,
To know that, to feel that—
We can fully co-create.
At that moment, it becomes clear:
That your reality is the manifestation of your mind,
Expressed in this physical dimension, through Heart and Being.
And your Being can serve its soul’s desire
To learn, love and create here.
So this is your power.
To recognize and accept that you are not simply an individual
Human Being who just happened to end up on Earth.
But rather, that you are an Infinite Powerful Being who chose to
be here. To incarnate in this 3-Dimensional realm to experience
the Creation first hand, as a holographic fractal of Source.
And once you remember who you are, you awaken.
Then your soul will show you why it chose to be here.
Why it incarnated as you specifically,
Why it chose your parents, your conditions, your location.
And as you absorb and accept these truths,
Your Being will earn trust.
And with this trust, your lifeforce will elevate.
Your soul—your Infinite Powerful Being—will unlock more and
more power for you to manifest what you need to accomplish
your work together.
These unlocks may be emotional, knowledge-based, or
physical. They may manifest in luxuries that reward your
physical self-to motivate and encourage deeper work on the
mission.
109

They may manifest in relationships and partnerships—
Or even in the termination of existing ones, to drive further
alignment and progress.
Whichever way these manifestations appear—
The one certain thing is: they will.
And you will notice.
And your power will spread.
For you to share. And pull others forward—
But only if they are ready.
Your power is God, Source, Universe; the fabric of your Being.
And God is only discovered and accepted from inside one’s
being. It needs no walls nor religious institutions to arise either.
And therefore, can and should never be forced.
And your power can never be manipulated or used to dominate
others—especially by those without materialized power.
To do so is to perpetuate the illusion of separation.
It risks the separation of soul from Source—for others and for
self, as well as the loss of true power.
Separation from Source is lost.
Lost power. Lost intention. Lost purpose. Lost self. Lost.
May you always remain a holographic fractal of God…
Shining light and love, and continually scratching the surface of
your Infinite Being’s Power.
Welcome to the One.
Welcome to the Bliss.
Welcome to your HUMAN POWER.
Welcome to SHISHARKA.
—
I deeply believe that some spiritual awakening will help benefit all
Humans, however you may find that! And always feel free to reach
out. My next wave of work will be going much deeper here

INSPIRATIONS…

​
A Major Thanks to:

The Universe and the Creator Source energy within all of us…and
this Game of God.
Neville Goddard, for identifying the “Secret Formula” that our inner
conversation between our conscious and subconscious minds is our
only reality and the path to program that conversation is your feelings,
dreams and prayer.
Aubrey Marcus, for being so vulnerable on his podcast and igniting
my spark and curiosity in “there maybe being more.” and Mattias
DeStafano, for piquing my interest in spirituality and mapping the
dimensions so clearly.
Lyndsay Cochran for coaching me on how to trust my intuition and
bring this work to life (@lyndsaycochran).
Todd Herman, for being such an inspiring leader on Identity and
author (see book below on Identity).
John Madsen, for turning me onto Neville and shaping my fitness
identity with Coach Jared Boyle in SupraHuman.
Father Sean O’Laoire, for opening my eyes to Christ Consciousness.
Alexandra Littaye for helping me visualize and get in touch with
Feelings and Stewart Gallas for forcing me to be honest about my

Feeling is the Secret by Neville Goddard
This is the foundation of my daily manifestation
program. This short 33 page book changed my
life and gave me the power to quit drinking and
so much more.
Alter Ego Effect by Todd Herman
I owe so much to this work. I believe the
foundational work I did here is how I built my
character and this program.
Rewired by Joe Dispenza on Gaia
If you haven’t read or watched Dr Joe, this is a
great first watch. I saw it right about the time I
finished the first draft and it was so powerful to
confirm my work. He is THE master.
Owaken Breathwork
Experienced live at an Aubrey Marcus event and
had a profound experience. Their app is well
done and what I use.

SupraHuman
The best fitness and mindset coaching around.
Can’t say enough good things. If you want $500
off, email me [dom@dailygrowthmap.com]
Transcendental Meditation
TM is the only meditation practice I’ve done that
really works for me. Everyone is different. I find
powerful peace in this practice, and it’s easy. It’s
worth doing the training, which I avoided for
years and wish I didn’t.

Be sure to say hi…
dom@dailygrowthmap.com

IG: @domgrowsdaily

Despite all my career and entrepreneurial
accomplishments, I’m most proud of this
program…before I even know how it’s
received by others…because creating it has
helped me build my relationship with God and
the Universe, which is reflective of building a
trusting relationship with myself by facing all
my own limiting beliefs and self-doubt, which
makes me a more powerful Human to serve
everyone around me.
Overcoming the self-doubt, and even
embarrassment of shifting from a hard-etched
Atheist to writing a book about tapping into
Spiritual Power has been RADICALLY
awesome and challenging. FWIW, my Atheist
facade was due to having religious
organizations force their way into my life as a
child; thus I’m still not religious, which I
probably don’t have to keep repeating :)
