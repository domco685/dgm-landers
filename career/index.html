        <h1>How I Broke Through the $500K Career Ceiling at Facebook, Instacart, and Shopify—By Feeling Like the Promotion Before I Got It</h1>
        
        <p style="font-size: 20px; color: #666; font-style: italic;">Promotions are backward-facing. Everyone says it, but no one explains what it means—or how to actually become the person who deserves the role before you have it.</p>
        
        <img src="assets/angle-03-hero.png" alt="Career success at top tech companies" class="hero-image">
        
        <h2>The Ceiling</h2>
        
        <p>I was crushing it.</p>
        
        <p>Growth lead at Facebook. Then Instacart. Then Shopify.</p>
        
        <p>High output. High ambition. Making an impact.</p>
        
        <p>But there was a problem:</p>
        
        <p><strong>I kept hitting a ceiling.</strong></p>
        
        <p>I wanted the next role. I <em>deserved</em> the next role.</p>
        
        <p>I was doing the work. Crushing the metrics. Leading projects.</p>
        
        <p>But the promotion wasn't coming.</p>
        
        <p>And here's what I didn't realize at the time:</p>
        
        <p><span class="highlight">The fact that I wanted it so badly was proof I wasn't ready for it.</span></p>
        
        <h2>The Truth About Promotions Nobody Tells You</h2>
        
        <p>Everyone says: <em>"Promotions are backward-facing."</em></p>
        
        <p>You've heard it a thousand times.</p>
        
        <p>But what does that actually <strong>mean</strong>?</p>
        
        <p>It means:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>You don't get promoted and <em>then</em> step into the role.</li>
            <li>You step into the role—energetically, mentally, emotionally—and <em>then</em> the promotion follows.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>But here's the part nobody explains:</p>
        
        <p><strong>How do you actually become that person?</strong></p>
        
        <p>How do you solve the problems that role solves when you're not in that role yet?</p>
        
        <p>How do you carry yourself like a senior leader when you're still an IC?</p>
        
        <p>The answer isn't what you think.</p>
        
        <img src="assets/angle-03-ceiling.png" alt="Glass ceiling visualization" class="hero-image">
        
        <h2>The Counterintuitive Truth: Feelings Are Strategic</h2>
        
        <p>Here's what I discovered:</p>
        
        <p><strong>You can't logic your way into a new identity.</strong></p>
        
        <p>You can study what leaders do. You can read the playbooks. You can mimic the behaviors.</p>
        
        <p>But if you don't <em>feel</em> like that person?</p>
        
        <p>Your energy will give you away.</p>
        
        <p>People can sense when you're <em>wanting</em> the role vs. <em>embodying</em> it.</p>
        
        <p>And here's the crazy part:</p>
        
        <div class="testimonial">
            <p>"Feelings aren't soft. They're technology—the language your subconscious uses to signal to others that you're energetically capable."</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>When you <em>want</em> the promotion, you're reinforcing that you're not ready.</p>
        
        <p>When you <em>embody</em> the promotion, it becomes inevitable.</p>
        
        <h2>How I Broke Through at Facebook, Instacart, and Shopify</h2>
        
        <p>The shift happened when I stopped trying to prove I deserved the role.</p>
        
        <p>Instead, I focused on one thing:</p>
        
        <p><strong>Becoming the person who already had it.</strong></p>
        
        <p>Here's what that looked like:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Study people already in that role:</strong> How do they act? What do they care about? What problems do they solve?</li>
            <li><strong>Build an identity around that:</strong> Not "fake it til you make it." FEEL it til you ARE it.</li>
            <li><strong>Use feelings to embody the role:</strong> What does it FEEL like to be that person? To solve those problems? To carry that energy?</li>
            <li><strong>Show up as that person NOW:</strong> Your energy signals readiness. The promotion becomes inevitable.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>I didn't get promoted and <em>then</em> step into the identity.</p>
        
        <p><strong>I stepped into the identity and <em>then</em> got promoted.</strong></p>
        
        <p>Every. Single. Time.</p>
        
        <img src="assets/angle-03-breakthrough.png" alt="Career breakthrough moment" class="hero-image">
        
        <h2>The Problem with High Ambition</h2>
        
        <p>If you're a high achiever, you know this feeling:</p>
        
        <p>You're ambitious. You're capable. You're crushing your current role.</p>
        
        <p>But you're not getting what you want.</p>
        
        <p>And when ambition doesn't match results?</p>
        
        <p><strong>You spin out.</strong></p>
        
        <p>You work harder. You take on more projects. You try to <em>prove</em> you're ready.</p>
        
        <p>But here's the trap:</p>
        
        <p><span class="highlight">You're solving yesterday's problems, not tomorrow's.</span></p>
        
        <p>You're working from the wrong identity.</p>
        
        <p>And no amount of hustle will fix that.</p>
        
        <h2>The ASKING Framework: Identity Alignment for High Performers</h2>
        
        <p>The system I used to break through isn't complicated.</p>
        
        <p>It's the same <strong>ASKING framework</strong> I used to quit drinking and lose 100 pounds.</p>
        
        <p>But applied to career.</p>
        
        <img src="assets/angle-03-asking-framework.png" alt="ASKING Framework for Career" class="framework-image hero-image">
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>A - Awareness:</strong> Notice what feelings are driving your current behavior</li>
            <li><strong>S - Sensations:</strong> Feel where those emotions live in your body</li>
            <li><strong>K - Knowing:</strong> Get clear on the identity of the role you want</li>
            <li><strong>I - Imagine:</strong> Step into that identity—what does it FEEL like?</li>
            <li><strong>N - Nurture:</strong> Sit with that feeling for 3 minutes</li>
            <li><strong>G - Generate:</strong> Let that identity reshape how you show up</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>I did this for <strong>3 minutes</strong> every night before bed.</p>
        
        <p>Then <strong>3 minutes</strong> in the morning.</p>
        
        <p>And <strong>30 seconds</strong> of reflection throughout the day.</p>
        
        <p>That's it.</p>
        
        <p><span class="highlight">I wasn't daydreaming. I was reprogramming my identity to match my ambition.</span></p>
        
        <p>And once my identity shifted?</p>
        
        <p><strong>The promotion followed automatically.</strong></p>

        <h2>The Results: Facebook → Instacart → Shopify</h2>
        
        <p>I didn't climb the ladder by working harder.</p>
        
        <p><strong>I leaped by becoming the person the next rung was built for.</strong></p>
        
        <p>Here's what changed:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>✅ Broke through the $500K ceiling</li>
            <li>✅ Moved from Facebook → Instacart → Shopify</li>
            <li>✅ Each leap came from embodying the next role FIRST</li>
            <li>✅ Not from wanting it—from BEING it</li>
            <li>✅ Promotions stopped being a fight and started being inevitable</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>But here's what matters more than the titles:</p>
        
        <p><strong>I stopped spinning out.</strong></p>
        
        <p>I stopped feeling like I had to prove myself.</p>
        
        <p>I stopped working from desperation.</p>
        
        <p><em>I just showed up as the person who already had the role.</em></p>
        
        <p>And the promotions followed.</p>
        
        <h2>Why Every Career Strategy You've Tried Has Failed</h2>
        
        <p>Let me guess:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>You've read the leadership books</li>
            <li>You've taken on stretch projects</li>
            <li>You've asked for feedback and acted on it</li>
            <li>You've proven your value over and over</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>And yet... the promotion still isn't coming.</p>
        
        <p>Here's why:</p>
        
        <p><span class="highlight">You were trying to prove you deserve the role without becoming the person who already has it.</span></p>
        
        <p>Proving = desperation.</p>
        
        <p>Embodying = readiness.</p>
        
        <p>People promote readiness, not desperation.</p>
        
        <p>The ASKING framework teaches you how to embody readiness.</p>
        
        <p>Once you do that, promotions stop being a battle.</p>
        
        <p><strong>They become inevitable.</strong></p>

        <p>You don't need to work harder.</p>
        
        <p>You don't need to "prove yourself."</p>
        
        <p>What you need is to align your identity with your ambition.</p>
        
        <p>Once you do that, promotions stop being something you <em>chase.</em></p>
        
        <p><strong>They become something that <em>finds you.</em></strong></p>
        
        <p>And that's when everything shifts.</p>
        
        <p style="text-align: center; margin: 50px 0; font-size: 24px; font-weight: 600;">The question is: Are you ready to stop proving and start embodying?</p>
