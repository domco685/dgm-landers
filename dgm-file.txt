In detail, what has been the biggest barrier to your success on social media so far?
I've been creating a decent amount of content, but organically, all of it falls kind of flat (<1k views) and
followers pretty much slowed down after I used ads to get followers. I don't think the followers I paid for
with ads are actually interested.

What’s your target audience avatar? (age, gender, location, anything else important)
Probably "career successful" men who work in tech or are entrepreneurs, or have some high ambition
professionally which has led them to distracting themselves from their feelings and establishing their self
worth based on how others relate to them. These men prob make north of $100K. They live in urban areas
most likely, spend a lot of money on traveling and lifestyle.

Have you established your client
avatar(s)?

No

Please describe your client avatar(s) in detail.
I don't think I have well enough, but you can see this: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y-sc9I1e3IhPhYEOW6fbeilbhPh1LDZnWsLMJb-Euc/edit?tab=t.0

What pain points does your audience have?
Despite being successful, they feel out of touch with their happiness.
They have a bunch of goals and know exactly how to accomplish them, have access to the right facilities
and coaches etc. They have the willpower and motivation, but just keep failing. They can't stay consistent.
They are losing trust in themselves.
This prob manifests in:
- Drinking and overeating
- Not being in good health
- Being angry
- Feeling burnt out at work, potentially trapped
- Spending more than they have
- Not feeling loved

What desires does your audience have?
To lead a healthy and happy life, to quit drinking, to feel full and complete on their own, to feel like they
have momentum.

Name 3 direct competitors of yours.
Mindvalley, TonyRobbins, Todd Herman

How do you help your clients?
They can follow the daily growth map practice which is a nightly journaling exercise, that helps them
program their subconscious by mapping a feeling to an identity of what they want. It's prob important to
watch the first 10m of this to understand what I'm doing https://youtu.be/aeyGqvH5qEQ

What does your company sell or do?
We sell a simple journaling book: https://www.amazon.com/DAILY-GROWTH-MAP-ManifestPowerful/dp/B0FQMWMT9D/ref=sr_1_1
But we're launching a community on skool and think this will make more sense.
I am thinking start at $22/mo or $114/year

What’s your offer?
Come to DAILY GROWTH MAP for 30 days to build your practice, stay for the community and support and
opportunity to mentor and support others.

Brand Identity
Describe your brand voice.

Authorative in a humble way (i.e., I talk about all the
challenges I've gone through), we are students of life together,
We don't get too-woo-woo but we're open to learning about
spiritual principles, we don't get religious.

Describe your brand tone.

Very casual, I swear, talk fast, am intense.

What is the main message your brand is trying to communicate?
Lasting change to reach your goals comes from building identity vs. motivation and willpower alone. The
way to build identity is to "feel" like that future self today and program your subconscious while you sleep.

Why do people choose you over your competitors?
No one has really chosen me yet! This is brand new to promote. I think it will be based on my story and my
message resonating.

What's your brand vision?
A large community of people who are well versed in the simple daily framework of the DAILY GROWTH
MAP who can help others.

Please list your brand’s four core values. These should be principles that guide your business
decisions and reflect what your brand stands for.
Identity drives lasting change.
Feelings are the language of the subconscious.
We are all curious students.
You can reframe any limiting belief, there's proof everywhere.

What is your busiest season or month? Please explain why and what that looks like.
IDK yet.

What are your top 4 content pillars? Content pillars are the main themes or topics that your
brand's content will revolve around. These should align with your core values and be relevant to
your target audience. They can also be hobbies or areas of interest.
Feelings to Action Loop/Hack: When you're having a hard time taking action you want to, you can tune-in
to how your future self will feel to help align your actions and make them more effortless. Just talking
through examples of this. Quick and Shareable...
Daily Maps: Dom doing his daily maps as an example of how he uses the framework this is the template
below. This is about 2-3minutes and more in depth. Ideally this is a longer version on YouTube that is cut
into 2minutes.

General Education and Interest:
Things that are related to manifestation and spirituality principles, that are synthesized in the least woo
way possible to bring into action. A few examples:
* Commentary over mindvalley content
* Explaining concepts from books
* challenges at work
* challenges with parents

Whatgoing
doesto be
success
lookoflike
to you
for this project?
I am
doing all
these
myself.
Really developing my voice and message and finding what resonates (Measured in followers, engagement
like shares).
Building the membership in my skool (will lead to book sales).

What work are you most proud of?
I am really proud of this book, DAILY GROWTH MAP, because its how I transformed and it can help others.
Also proud of www.happyhoots.com (since that will plant many trees).
Proud of winning Global Student Entrepreneur of the year when in college, and a lot of huge wins I've had a
Facebook and Shopify.

Content Direction
What type of content does your audience respond to best?
I'm not sure yet! I think just more authentic, but still authoritative
https://www.instagram.com/domgrowsdaily/

What message are your trying to send with your content?
Motivation and consistency alone do not create lasting change. You have to become your future self and

shift into a new identity. And the best way to do that is by using feelings to program your subconscious
right before you go to sleep and throughout the day to reframe limiting beliefs.
Another message that's more meta or macro is that a lot of the manifestation and spirituality principles
that are rooted in mysticism have come across as very woo-woo to people. And as a result, a lot of actionoriented and ambitious career-driven people have ignored them because they can't make sense of the
mysticism.
It doesn't work with their more logical, scientifically-minded brains. And I aim to create a gateway for
reducing the woo and talking about how some of these have created more human power in my career and
life to allow me to be a higher performer.

Do you have examples of other accounts you like?
A lot of this stuff is'nt podcast style. I just assume most of the studio work will be podcast related, but this
is interesting to me.

Do you have any reference videos or content links you like?
See above

Topics or ideas that you think would make for a great video (this is optional but would help to
make content you want to talk about)
Men shouldn't talk about feelings... this is a hook to talk abtuo how we shoudl.
Manifestation is for the WooWoo, people who don't know how to take action - this is a hook to talk about
how manifestation is about aligning actions to desire
Consistency and Willpower aren't enough alone - need to change an identity

As social media trends change, are
you open to changing with the trends?

Yes, I am open to changing with the trends to maximize
exposure

Are you open to a more polarizing kind of content? Or would you prefer not to ruffle too many
feathers? (being controversial sometimes can get more views & engagement)
Yeah, for sure. I think some of those contents above like men shouldn't have feelings or talk about feelings
and manifestation is just for the woo-woo is good.

Results & Resources

What results have you achieved — for yourself and your clients?
This is brand new. And so it's really just me who's gone through this, but the narrative is on my website. So
I'll link that, but essentially some pretty major changes. I'll also put a YouTube video in here.

Do you have resources (cheat sheets, PDFs, etc.) you could give away for free? If so, which
ones?
Yeah, definitely. There's like a reframing limiting belief ones. There's a seven day challenge to do the
program. I have an AI that people could go through.

Starter and Premium Packages Only

These questions are required and relevant for paid ad clients.
What’s the main front-end offer we’ll be promoting with paid traffic?
I'm still kind of debating this, but right now it's just buying the book. But I think what I'm going to do is
having the book actually be accessed to a community. So when you buy the book, the program, etc., it's
like $33 or $22 and it gets you into the community for a month.
And then you can choose to stay or not, but the community is where we discuss everything. And then if
you join the community, it's basically the same price. And then you have a coupon code where you can
order the book for free. So it's kind of like the book always comes for free.

Which cities or zip codes would you like to target?
I think this is like worldwide, but I know that doesn't help. I think that probably the target audience is men
who are ambitious and career driven, who have a career in tech most likely, or like some sort of like more
professional like lawyer, doctor, etc. And they're probably in cities and they probably have a lot of
disposable income.
They probably travel a lot. They probably spend a lot of money outsourcing self-worth. They probably care
a lot about external validation from materialistic things. and from the women they date, all of that stuff.

What are your top 1–2 services you want more leads for?
I think I really just want to get people into the community and eventually create a paid community. It might
be paid to start.

Any special offers, promos, or discounts we should advertise?
I think this is kind of like up for debate.

What makes your business stand out from competitors?
I mean, really, I think that's just me. It's like my story. It's whether or not people resonate with the
background that I have, being in big tech and being a founder and having these challenges and then
getting over them and the way that I speak from humility but still have some authority.

What are the top 2–3 FAQs or objections you typically get from new clients?
Manifestation is just for the woo-woo, and there's no way that you can just imagine things into reality. I
think an objection to that is, well, this is about changing the identity, not about material objects.

Is there anything you'd prefer we DON'T mention in the ads?
I'd like to just be cautious of how far we go on the drinking stuff because it's a big part of my story, but I
don't want to come across like I was a hopeless alcoholic because that's not going to help. Because
actually it's the exact opposite. It was like I was a highly functioning alcoholic and really had my stuff
together career-wise, just not personally.
And I think that's the audience that I'm trying to reach. But I don't want it to ever come across like I was
down and out and broke and all of that because that just wasn't me.
