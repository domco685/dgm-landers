            <p class="subhead">How I lost 100 lbs, quit drinking, and saved $1M—by changing who I believed I was</p>
        </div>

        <div class="article-content">
            <p>I was sitting in a conference room at Facebook in 2019, staring at my laptop screen.</p>

            <p>Salary: $240,000 a year.</p>

            <p>Stock options worth another $100K.</p>

            <p>Title that made my mom proud.</p>

            <p>And I felt... nothing.</p>

            <p>Actually, that's not true. I felt empty. Hollow. Like I was watching someone else live my life.</p>

            <h2>The Achievement Trap</h2>

            <p>For 15 years, I did everything right.</p>

            <p>Got the degree. Landed the job. Climbed the ladder. Made the money.</p>

            <p>Facebook. Then Shopify. Director-level by 35. The whole package.</p>

            <p>But here's what nobody tells you about "making it": <strong>The emptiness doesn't go away when you hit six figures. It gets worse.</strong></p>

            <p>Because now you don't even have an excuse. You're supposed to be happy. You have everything you worked for.</p>

            <p>So why do you feel like this?</p>

            <div class="stats-inline">
                <div class="stat">
                    <span class="stat-number">$240K</span>
                    <span class="stat-label">Annual Salary</span>

                </div>
            </div>

            <h2>The Morning Routine That Wasn't</h2>

            <p>My alarm went off at 6:47 AM.</p>

            <p>Not 6:45. Not 7:00. 6:47.</p>

            <p>I'd read some article about how successful people wake up early, so I set this random time to feel like I was optimizing something.</p>

            <p>I'd hit snooze twice. Scroll Instagram for 20 minutes. Feel guilty about both.</p>

            <p>At 275 pounds, I couldn't see my feet in the shower. My wedding ring cut into my finger. I'd stopped looking at photos of myself.</p>

            <p>But the worst part wasn't the weight.</p>

            <p>It was the drinking.</p>

            <h2>Two Bottles of Wine. Every Night.</h2>

            <p>I didn't think I had a problem.</p>

            <p>I was a "functional drinker." I never missed work. Never got a DUI. Never had a dramatic breakdown.</p>

            <p>I just... needed it.</p>

            <p>So I'd pour a glass of wine at 6 PM. Then another at 7. By 9, I'd finished the bottle. By 10, I'd opened a second.</p>

            <p>My wife stopped commenting on it after a while. What was she going to say? I wasn't falling down drunk. I was just... numbing out.</p>

            <p>Every single night. For five years.</p>

            <h2>The $1 Million I Didn't Have</h2>

            <p>Here's the math that broke me:</p>

            <p>$240K salary at Facebook. Three years. $180K at Shopify before that. Four years. $120K at my first startup. Two years.</p>

            <p>Total earned over 9 years: <strong>Roughly $1.6 million before taxes.</strong></p>

            <p>Amount in my bank account in 2019: <strong>$87,000.</strong></p>

            <p>Where did $1 million go? I don't know.</p>

            <p>I made more money than 94% of Americans. And I had nothing to show for it except a gut that hung over my belt and a nightly wine habit.</p>

            <h2>The Moment Everything Changed</h2>

            <p>October 12, 2019. I remember the date because it was my daughter's 6th birthday party.</p>

            <p>We were at the park. She was running around with her friends. I was sitting on a bench, sweating through my shirt, out of breath from walking 100 yards from the car.</p>

            <p>Another dad—a guy I barely knew—sat down next to me.</p>

            <p>"You doing okay, man?"</p>

            <p>I said I was fine. Just tired from work.</p>

            <p>He nodded. Didn't push it.</p>

            <p>Then he said something I'll never forget:</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p>"I used to feel like that too. Like I was living someone else's life. Turns out I was."</p>
            </div>

            <h2>The Identity I Didn't Choose</h2>

            <p>That night, I couldn't stop thinking about what he said. <em>Living someone else's life.</em></p>

            <p>Because that's exactly what it felt like.</p>

            <p>I wasn't the guy who drank two bottles of wine every night. That wasn't me. I wasn't the guy who weighed 275 pounds. That wasn't me either.</p>

            <p>But... it was. Because that's what I did. Every. Single. Day.</p>

            <p>And here's what I finally understood:</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>You don't do what you think. You do what you believe you are.</strong></p>
            </div>

            <p>I believed I was:</p>
            <ul style="color: #C0C0C0; margin: 20px 0 30px 30px;">
                <li>A stressed executive who needed wine to relax</li>
                <li>A busy professional who didn't have time to work out</li>
                <li>A successful person who deserved to spend money on whatever I wanted</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Those beliefs ran my life. Not my goals. Not my plans. Not my "intentions." <strong>My identity.</strong></p>

            <h2>The 30-Day Experiment</h2>

            <p>I didn't try to fix everything at once.</p>

            <p>I didn't set a goal to lose 100 pounds. I didn't vow to never drink again. I didn't create a budget or hire a financial planner.</p>

            <p>Instead, I did something different.</p>

            <p>I asked myself: <em>Who is the version of me that doesn't need wine to relax?</em></p>

            <p>And I started acting like that person.</p>

            <p>Not by forcing habits. Not by willpower. Not by some 47-step morning routine.</p>

            <p><strong>By deciding who I was... and then noticing when I acted out of alignment with that identity.</strong></p>

            <p>I called it an identity shift. And I gave myself 30 days to see if it worked.</p>

            <div class="stats-inline">
                <div class="stat">
                    <span class="stat-number">Week 1</span>
                    <span class="stat-label">Awareness</span>
                </div>
                <div class="stat">

                    <span class="stat-label">The Shift</span>

                <div class="stat">

                </div>
            </div>

            <h2>90 Days Later</h2>

            <p>Three months after that birthday party:</p>

            <ul style="color: #C0C0C0; margin: 20px 0 30px 30px;">
                <li><strong>Weight:</strong> 242 pounds (down 33)</li>
                <li><strong>Alcohol:</strong> Zero drinks</li>
                <li><strong>Savings:</strong> $14,000 in the bank</li>
                <li><strong>Energy:</strong> I could run up stairs without stopping</li>
            </ul>

            <p>But here's what really changed:</p>

            <p>I woke up at 6:30 AM without an alarm. I looked in the mirror and recognized myself. I showed up at work clear-headed, confident, present.</p>

            <p>My wife said something that made me cry: <strong>"It feels like I got my husband back."</strong></p>

            <h2>Two Years Later</h2>

            <p>Today, I weigh 190 pounds. I haven't had a drink in 847 days. I've saved over $180,000.</p>

            <p>But the number that matters most: <strong>I feel like myself again.</strong></p>

            <p>Not the self I was pretending to be for 15 years. The self I always was, buried under achievement, pressure, and numbing.</p>

            <div class="cta-box">

                <p>After I transformed my own life, I created the DAILY GROWTH MAP—a 30-day identity-shift protocol that helps you become who you're meant to be.</p>

            <h2>Who This Is For</h2>

            <p>This isn't for everyone.</p>

            <p>If you're happy with your life right now, you don't need this.</p>

            <p>But if you're like I was—<strong>high income, low fulfillment</strong>—successful on paper, empty inside—doing all the "right things" and feeling nothing—then this might be exactly what you need.</p>

            <p>Because you don't need more discipline. You don't need another goal.</p>

            <p>You need to become who you already are.</p>
