# Angle 2: "Why High-Achievers Stay Stuck (And the 'Feeling Formula' That Breaks the Cycle)"

## Why This Works

- **Broader appeal** = "stuck" pain point (covers career, relationships, money)
- **Paradox** = you're successful but still stuck (target audience relatability)
- **Curiosity gap** = "Feeling Formula" (mystery ingredient vibe)
- **Editorial tone** = feels like investigative journalism, not a pitch
- **Identity-first** = positions feelings as the subconscious language (core DGM insight)
