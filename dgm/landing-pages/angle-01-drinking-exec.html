        <div class="content">
            <h2>The Breaking Point</h2>
            <p>I was standing in my kitchen at 2 AM, holding an empty bottle of whiskey, staring at my reflection in the microwave door.</p>
            <p>275 pounds. Puffy face. Dead eyes.</p>
            <p>I was a growth lead at Facebook. Then Shopify. I'd scaled products to millions of users. I knew how to optimize funnels, crush KPIs, and lead teams.</p>
            <p>But I couldn't stop drinking.</p>
            <p>Twenty years I'd been trying. Twenty years of "this time will be different."</p>
            <p>White-knuckling through day 3, then collapsing on day 4. Discipline. Willpower. Accountability partners. Apps. Therapists. Books.</p>
            <p>Nothing worked.</p>
            <p>Because I was fighting the wrong battle.</p>

            <h2>The Discovery That Changed Everything</h2>
            <p>In 2019, I did something desperate.</p>
            <p>I flew to Costa Rica for an ayahuasca ceremony.</p>
            <p>I'm not woo-woo. I'm a data guy. But I was out of options. I thought maybe I'd find some mystical cure, some spiritual reset button.</p>
            <p>What I got instead was brutal clarity.</p>
            <p>During the ceremony, I heard a voice—my voice—crystal clear:</p>
            <p class="highlight">"You drink because you can't control your feelings."</p>
            <p>Not because I lacked discipline. Not because I was weak. Not because I hadn't read the right book or found the right system.</p>
            <p>I drank because I was <strong>terrified</strong> of feeling.</p>
            <p>Success felt like pressure. Failure felt like death. Emptiness felt like falling. So I numbed it all.</p>
            <p>The ayahuasca didn't fix me. But it showed me the real problem.</p>
            <p>And once I knew that, everything changed.</p>

            <h2>The Book That Unlocked the Solution</h2>
            <p>A week after I got back from Costa Rica, someone recommended a book: <em>Feeling is the Secret</em> by Neville Goddard.</p>
            <p>70 pages. Written in the 1940s. Looked like self-help nonsense.</p>
            <p>But the premise hit different:</p>
            <p class="highlight">Your subconscious mind speaks the language of feelings.</p>
            <p>Not thoughts. Not affirmations. Not vision boards.</p>
            <p><em>Feelings.</em></p>
            <p>If you want to change your behavior, you don't need more willpower. You need to change the <em>feeling</em> that's driving the behavior.</p>
            <p>I was drinking to escape bad feelings. But what if I could <em>generate</em> the feelings I actually wanted?</p>
            <p>What if I could teach my nervous system that I was already the person who didn't need alcohol?</p>
            <p>That's when I built the system.</p>

            <h2>The ASKING Framework: 3 Minutes to Rewire Your Identity</h2>
            <p>I'm an engineer at heart. I needed a process.</p>
            <p>So I reverse-engineered Neville Goddard's work and built the <strong>ASKING framework</strong>:</p>

            <!-- ASKING Framework Visual -->
            <img src="assets/angle-01-asking-framework.png" alt="ASKING framework visual diagram" class="framework-image">

            <ul>
                <li><strong>A</strong>wareness → Notice what you're feeling right now</li>
                <li><strong>S</strong>ensations → Describe it in your body (where, how intense, texture)</li>
                <li><strong>K</strong>nowing → Ask: "What do I <em>know</em> to be true about myself right now?"</li>
                <li><strong>I</strong>magine → Who is the version of me that doesn't have this problem?</li>
                <li><strong>N</strong>urture → Feel what <em>that person</em> feels. Embody it. Breathe it in.</li>
                <li><strong>G</strong>enerate → Carry that feeling into your day</li>
            </ul>

            <p>It takes <strong>3 minutes</strong>.</p>
            <p>I did it every night before bed. Then again in the morning. Then a quick reflection at night.</p>
            <p>I didn't "quit drinking." I became someone who didn't drink.</p>

            <h2>What Happened Next</h2>
            
            <!-- Before/After Image -->
            <img src="assets/angle-01-before-after.png" alt="Before and after transformation concept" class="before-after">

            <p>Within 30 days, I stopped craving alcohol.</p>
            <p>Not through discipline. Through <strong>identity shift</strong>.</p>
            <p>My nervous system started to believe: "I'm the guy who doesn't drink."</p>
            <p>And once that became my default feeling? The behavior followed effortlessly.</p>
            <p>But it didn't stop there.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lost 85 pounds</strong> (now 190 lbs, the healthiest I've been in 20 years)</li>
                <li><strong>Saved over $1,000,000</strong> (between alcohol, health costs, and poor financial decisions)</li>
                <li><strong>Rebuilt my relationships</strong> (my wife, my kids, my friends)</li>
                <li><strong>Launched my own business</strong> (no longer numbing my ambition)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>All from the same 3-minute practice.</p>
            <p>Because once you learn to control your feelings, you control everything.</p>

            <h2>Why This Works When Willpower Fails</h2>
            <p>Here's the truth no one tells you:</p>
            <p class="highlight">Willpower is a lie.</p>
            <p>You can't discipline your way out of a subconscious pattern.</p>
            <p>Your subconscious is 1,000,000x more powerful than your conscious mind. It runs on autopilot. It's programmed by <em>feelings</em>, not logic.</p>
            <p>So when you try to "just stop drinking" with willpower, you're fighting your own nervous system.</p>
            <p>You're saying: "I want to change."<br>
            Your subconscious is saying: "But you <em>feel</em> like someone who drinks."</p>
            <p>Guess who wins?</p>
            <p>The ASKING framework flips the script.</p>
            <p>Instead of fighting your identity, you <em>reprogram</em> it.</p>
            <p>You teach your subconscious: "I'm someone who doesn't need alcohol."</p>
            <p>And once it believes that? The cravings disappear.</p>

            <h2>The Daily Growth Map: Your Step-by-Step System</h2>
            <p>After I transformed my life, people started asking me: "How did you do it?"</p>
            <p>So I wrote it all down.</p>
            <p>The <strong>Daily Growth Map</strong> is a complete system for reprogramming your subconscious through feelings.</p>
            <p>Inside, you'll get:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><span class="checkmark">✓</span> <strong>The full ASKING framework</strong> (step-by-step instructions)</li>
                <li><span class="checkmark">✓</span> <strong>3-minute daily practice templates</strong> (bedtime, morning, reflection)</li>
                <li><span class="checkmark">✓</span> <strong>Identity architecture guide</strong> (who do you need to <em>become</em> to get what you want?)</li>
                <li><span class="checkmark">✓</span> <strong>30-day transformation roadmap</strong> (real change takes consistency, not intensity)</li>
                <li><span class="checkmark">✓</span> <strong>Subconscious reprogramming scripts</strong> (feeling generators for any area of life)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This isn't theory. This is the exact system I used to quit drinking, lose 85 pounds, and rebuild my life.</p>
            <p>And it works for <em>any</em> area where you feel stuck:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Drinking or substance use</li>
                <li>Weight and health</li>
                <li>Career plateaus</li>
                <li>Relationship patterns</li>
                <li>Money blocks</li>
                <li>Anger and burnout</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Because the root cause is always the same: <strong>You're living from the wrong feelings.</strong></p>

            <h2>This Is for You If...</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="checkmark">✓</span> You've tried to quit drinking (or lose weight, or change something) and always relapse</li>
                <li><span class="checkmark">✓</span> You're successful on paper but feel empty inside</li>
                <li><span class="checkmark">✓</span> You know what to do, but you can't make yourself do it</li>
                <li><span class="checkmark">✓</span> You're tired of white-knuckling through life with "discipline"</li>
                <li><span class="checkmark">✓</span> You suspect the problem is deeper than behavior—it's <em>identity</em></li>
            </ul>

            <p>If that's you, this system will change your life.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">A: That's exactly why this works. You've been fighting the wrong battle. This isn't about discipline. It's about identity. Once you shift <em>who you are</em>, the behavior changes automatically.</div>
