## HOOK: THE CEILING

**Opening Story:**
- Crushing it professionally
- High ambition, high output
- But hitting a ceiling
- Want the promotion, but not getting it
- High achiever spinning out when ambition doesn't match results

**Copy Angle:**
The problem: When you WANT a promotion, you reinforce that you're NOT that role yet.

**Key Line:**
"Wanting the promotion is proof you're not ready for it."

**Image Spec:**
- Visual metaphor: glass ceiling, or ladder with missing rungs
- Alt: Someone staring at the next level, unable to reach it

---

## THE DISCOVERY: PROMOTIONS ARE BACKWARD-FACING

**The Truth Everyone Hears But Doesn't Understand:**
"Promotions are backward-facing."

**What That Actually Means:**
- You need to BECOME the person deserving of the promotion BEFORE you get it
- You need to solve the problems that role solves, not the problems you solve today
- "What got you here won't get you there" ← but how do you actually make the leap?

**The Counterintuitive Piece:**
Feelings are the secret key.

**Copy Angle:**
It sounds crazy that feelings matter in the workplace.
But feelings are technology—the language your subconscious uses to communicate.
And your subconscious controls how you show up energetically.

**Image Spec:**
- Split comparison: "Current role problems" vs "Next role problems"
- Or: Before/after energy (stuck vs confident leadership presence)

---

## THE METHOD: BECOME THE ROLE FIRST

**How to Actually Do It:**

1. **Study people already in that role**
   - How do they act?
   - What do they care about?
   - What problems do they solve?

2. **Build an identity around that**
   - Not fake it til you make it
   - FEEL it til you ARE it

3. **Use feelings to embody the role**
   - What does it FEEL like to be that person?
   - What does it feel like to solve those problems?
   - How do they carry themselves energetically?

4. **Show up as that person NOW**
   - Your energy signals readiness
   - The promotion becomes inevitable

**Copy Angle:**
You don't get promoted and THEN step into the identity.
You step into the identity and THEN get promoted.

**Image Spec:**
- Process flow: Study → Identify → Feel → Embody → Promote
- Clean, executive-friendly design (not woo-woo)

---

## THE BREAKTHROUGH: FEELINGS ARE WORKPLACE TECHNOLOGY

**The Counterintuitive Truth:**
Feelings aren't soft. They're strategic.

**What Feelings Do:**
- Speak to your subconscious
- Signal to others that you're energetically capable
- Program your identity at a level logic can't reach

**The Problem with High Ambition:**
When you're highly ambitious and NOT getting what you want, you spin out.
You work harder, but from the wrong identity.
You're solving yesterday's problems, not tomorrow's.

**The Solution:**
Align your ambition with embodied identity.
Channel ambition through feelings.
Become the role, then the promotion follows.

**Copy Angle:**
This is how I broke through at Facebook, Instacart, and Shopify.
Not by wanting it more. By BEING it first.

**Image Spec:**
- Leadership presence visual (confident, grounded, powerful)
- Or: Energy shift diagram (desperate want → embodied readiness)
