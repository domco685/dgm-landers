# The 3-Minute Bedtime Habit That Helped a Facebook Exec Quit Drinking—Without Willpower

## Hook: The Breaking Point

I was standing in my kitchen at 2 AM, holding an empty bottle of whiskey, staring at my reflection in the microwave door.

275 pounds. Puffy face. Dead eyes.

I was a growth lead at Facebook. Then Shopify. I'd scaled products to millions of users. I knew how to optimize funnels, crush KPIs, and lead teams.

But I couldn't stop drinking.

Twenty years I'd been trying. Twenty years of "this time will be different."

White-knuckling through day 3, then collapsing on day 4. Discipline. Willpower. Accountability partners. Apps. Therapists. Books.

Nothing worked.

Because I was fighting the wrong battle.

## The Discovery That Changed Everything

In 2019, I did something desperate.

I flew to Costa Rica for an ayahuasca ceremony.

I'm not woo-woo. I'm a data guy. But I was out of options. I thought maybe I'd find some mystical cure, some spiritual reset button.

What I got instead was brutal clarity.

During the ceremony, I heard a voice—my voice—crystal clear:

**"You drink because you can't control your feelings."**

Not because I lacked discipline. Not because I was weak. Not because I hadn't read the right book or found the right system.

I drank because I was **terrified** of feeling.

Success felt like pressure. Failure felt like death. Emptiness felt like falling. So I numbed it all.

The ayahuasca didn't fix me. But it showed me the real problem.

And once I knew that, everything changed.

## The Book That Unlocked the Solution

A week after I got back from Costa Rica, someone recommended a book: *Feeling is the Secret* by Neville Goddard.

70 pages. Written in the 1940s. Looked like self-help nonsense.

But the premise hit different:

**Your subconscious mind speaks the language of feelings.**

Not thoughts. Not affirmations. Not vision boards.

*Feelings.*

If you want to change your behavior, you don't need more willpower. You need to change the *feeling* that's driving the behavior.

I was drinking to escape bad feelings. But what if I could *generate* the feelings I actually wanted?

What if I could teach my nervous system that I was already the person who didn't need alcohol?

That's when I built the system.

## The ASKING Framework: 3 Minutes to Rewire Your Identity

I'm an engineer at heart. I needed a process.

So I reverse-engineered Neville Goddard's work and built the **ASKING framework**:

- **A**wareness → Notice what you're feeling right now
- **S**ensations → Describe it in your body (where, how intense, texture)
- **K**nowing → Ask: "What do I *know* to be true about myself right now?"
- **I**magine → Who is the version of me that doesn't have this problem?
- **N**urture → Feel what *that person* feels. Embody it. Breathe it in.
- **G**enerate → Carry that feeling into your day

It takes **3 minutes**.

I did it every night before bed. Then again in the morning. Then a quick reflection at night.

I didn't "quit drinking." I became someone who didn't drink.

---

## What Happened Next

Within 30 days, I stopped craving alcohol.

Not through discipline. Through **identity shift**.

My nervous system started to believe: "I'm the guy who doesn't drink."

And once that became my default feeling? The behavior followed effortlessly.

But it didn't stop there.

- **Lost 85 pounds** (now 190 lbs, the healthiest I've been in 20 years)
- **Saved over $1,000,000** (between alcohol, health costs, and poor financial decisions)
- **Rebuilt my relationships** (my wife, my kids, my friends)
- **Launched my own business** (no longer numbing my ambition)

All from the same 3-minute practice.

Because once you learn to control your feelings, you control everything.

## Why This Works When Willpower Fails

Here's the truth no one tells you:

**Willpower is a lie.**

You can't discipline your way out of a subconscious pattern.

Your subconscious is 1,000,000x more powerful than your conscious mind. It runs on autopilot. It's programmed by *feelings*, not logic.

So when you try to "just stop drinking" with willpower, you're fighting your own nervous system.

You're saying: "I want to change."
Your subconscious is saying: "But you *feel* like someone who drinks."

Guess who wins?

The ASKING framework flips the script.

Instead of fighting your identity, you *reprogram* it.

You teach your subconscious: "I'm someone who doesn't need alcohol."

And once it believes that? The cravings disappear.

## The Daily Growth Map: Your Step-by-Step System

## FAQ

**Q: Is this just journaling?**  
A: No. Journaling is thinking on paper. This is *subconscious reprogramming through feelings*. There's a massive difference.

**Q: Do I need to believe in manifestation or spirituality?**  
A: Nope. I'm a data-driven tech guy. This is neuroscience wrapped in practical psychology. It works whether you believe in woo-woo stuff or not.

**Q: How long until I see results?**  
A: Most people feel a shift within 7 days. Real transformation takes 30 days of consistency. But the practice itself takes 3 minutes, so it's easy to stick with.

**Q: What if I've tried everything and nothing worked?**  
A: That's exactly why this works. You've been fighting the wrong battle. This isn't about discipline. It's about identity. Once you shift *who you are*, the behavior changes automatically.

**Q: Is this only for drinking?**  
A: No. The ASKING framework works for anything: weight, career, relationships, money, anger. The method is universal because the root cause is always feelings.
