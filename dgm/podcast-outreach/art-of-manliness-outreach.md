## Outreach Message

**Subject:** your episode on health goals hit home

brett - loved your episodes on not following through on health goals and helping disengaged young men reclaim drive. Sounds like your audience is navigating that gap between knowing what to do and actually doing it, especially around sustained behavior change.

an angle I don't hear explored much is that feelings are actually this human technology, the language of the subconscious. despite being a tech exec at facebook and shopify, I was 275 lbs with a 20-year drinking problem, running on pure discipline until it broke me. didn't figure it out until I learned to work with my feelings instead of numbing them - lost 100 lbs, manifested sobriety, saved over a milion, total identity shift.

if that feels useful for your audience, happy to explore whether it fits your format.

best,  
dom
