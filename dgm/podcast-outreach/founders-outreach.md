**Subject:** founder psychology question

david - been binging your podcast for months. the way you extract founder psychology and character from their stories is unmatched. Sounds like your audience is navigating those internal patterns that separate builders who sustain versus those who burn out.

one angle I don't hear explored much in founder stories is that feelings are actually this human technology, the language of the subconscious. I was a growth lead at facebook and shopify, 275 lbs with a 20-year drinking problem, running on pure discipline until it broke me. an ayahuasca ceremony in costa rica cracked me open, discovered neville goddard's teaching that feelings are the creative force - manifested sobriety, lost 85 lbs, saved over a million, total identity reinvention through emotional mastery.

if that feels like a useful case study for your format, happy to explore it.

best,
