**Subject:** matthew hussey episode

chris - loved your episode with matthew hussey on relationships, especially the part about knowing if you're with the right person or just telling yourself you are. Sounds like your audience is navigating that tension between external achievement and internal fulfillment.

an angle I don't hear explored much is that feelings are actually this human technology, the language of the subconscious. despite crushing it as a growth lead at facebook and shopify, I was 275 lbs with a 20-year drinking problem, dying inside. didn't figure it out until I learned to work with my feelings instead of numbing them - manifested sobriety, lost 85 lbs, saved over a milion, all through feelings not discipline.

if that feels useful for your format, happy to explore whether it fits.

best,  
dom
