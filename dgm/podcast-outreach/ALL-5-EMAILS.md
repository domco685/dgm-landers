## 1. The Art of Manliness - Brett McKay
**Contact:** team@artofmanliness.com  
**Subject:** your episode on health goals hit home

brett - loved your episodes on not following through on health goals and helping disengaged young men reclaim drive. Sounds like your audience is navigating that gap between knowing what to do and actually doing it, especially around sustained behavior change.

an angle I don't hear explored much is that feelings are actually this human technology, the language of the subconscious. despite being a tech exec at facebook and shopify, I was 275 lbs with a 20-year drinking problem, running on pure discipline until it broke me. didn't figure it out until I learned to work with my feelings instead of numbing them - lost 100 lbs, manifested sobriety, saved over a milion, total identity shift.

if that feels useful for your audience, happy to explore whether it fits your format.

## 2. Founders Podcast - David Senra
**Contact:** founders@founderspodcast.com  
**Subject:** founder psychology question

david - been binging your podcast for months. the way you extract founder psychology and character from their stories is unmatched. Sounds like your audience is navigating those internal patterns that separate builders who sustain versus those who burn out.

one angle I don't hear explored much in founder stories is that feelings are actually this human technology, the language of the subconscious. I was a growth lead at facebook and shopify, 275 lbs with a 20-year drinking problem, running on pure discipline until it broke me. an ayahuasca ceremony in costa rica cracked me open, discovered neville goddard's teaching that feelings are the creative force - manifested sobriety, lost 85 lbs, saved over a million, total identity reinvention through emotional mastery.

if that feels like a useful case study for your format, happy to explore it.

## 3. Modern Wisdom - Chris Williamson
**Contact:** @chriswillx (DM)  
**Subject:** matthew hussey episode

chris - loved your episode with matthew hussey on relationships, especially the part about knowing if you're with the right person or just telling yourself you are. Sounds like your audience is navigating that tension between external achievement and internal fulfillment.

an angle I don't hear explored much is that feelings are actually this human technology, the language of the subconscious. despite crushing it as a growth lead at facebook and shopify, I was 275 lbs with a 20-year drinking problem, dying inside. didn't figure it out until I learned to work with my feelings instead of numbing them - manifested sobriety, lost 85 lbs, saved over a milion, all through feelings not discipline.

if that feels useful for your format, happy to explore whether it fits.

## 4. The Knowledge Project - Shane Parrish
**Contact:** hello@fs.blog  
**Subject:** morgan housel wealth episode

shane - loved your episode with morgan housel on wealth being what you have minus what you want. that discussion about how the skills to get rich are totally different from the skills to stay rich really landed. Sounds like your audience is navigating how mental models work externally but leave something missing internally.

an angle I don't hear explored much is that feelings are actually this human technology, the language of the subconscious. I was a growth lead at facebook and shopify, making great money but 275 lbs with a drinking problem. discovered that "wanting less" wasn't a mindset shift - it was learning to decode what my feelings were actually telling me. manifested sobriety and lost 85 lbs without disicpline.

if that feels useful to explore, happy to discuss whether it fits your show.

## 5. ManTalks - Connor Beaton
**Contact:** hello@mantalks.com  
**Subject:** self-worth episode

connor - loved your episode on developing self-worth as a man, and the one on why 45% of young men have never asked someone out. Sounds like your audience is wrestling with the roots of masculine identity and how to build genuine self-worth when it's been outsourced to external validation.

an angle I don't hear explored much in men's work is that feelings are actually this human technology, the language of the subconscious. I was a growth lead at facebook and shopify, 275 lbs with a 20-year drinking problem, my entire identity built on performance and numbing. ayahuasca in costa rica cracked me open, discovered that self-worth isn't built through accomplishment - it's unlocked by learning to decode what your feelings are telling you. manifested sobriety, lost 85 lbs, transformed evrything.

if that feels like a useful conversation for your audience, happy to explore it.
