**Subject:** morgan housel wealth episode

shane - loved your episode with morgan housel on wealth being what you have minus what you want. that discussion about how the skills to get rich are totally different from the skills to stay rich really landed. Sounds like your audience is navigating how mental models work externally but leave something missing internally.

an angle I don't hear explored much is that feelings are actually this human technology, the language of the subconscious. I was a growth lead at facebook and shopify, making great money but 275 lbs with a drinking problem. discovered that "wanting less" wasn't a mindset shift - it was learning to decode what my feelings were actually telling me. manifested sobriety and lost 85 lbs without disicpline.

if that feels useful to explore, happy to discuss whether it fits your show.

best,  
dom
