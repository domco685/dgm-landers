## Outreach Message

**Subject:** self-worth episode

connor - loved your episode on developing self-worth as a man, and the one on why 45% of young men have never asked someone out. Sounds like your audience is wrestling with the roots of masculine identity and how to build genuine self-worth when it's been outsourced to external validation.

an angle I don't hear explored much in men's work is that feelings are actually this human technology, the language of the subconscious. I was a growth lead at facebook and shopify, 275 lbs with a 20-year drinking problem, my entire identity built on performance and numbing. ayahuasca in costa rica cracked me open, discovered that self-worth isn't built through accomplishment - it's unlocked by learning to decode what your feelings are telling you. manifested sobriety, lost 85 lbs, transformed evrything.

if that feels like a useful conversation for your audience, happy to explore it.

best,  
dom
