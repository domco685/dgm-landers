        <h1>The Identity Shift That Helped Me Lose 100 Pounds—Without Another Failed Diet</h1>
        
        <p style="font-size: 20px; color: #666; font-style: italic;">I had discipline. I had the right coaches. I knew exactly what to do. But I kept losing trust in myself—until I discovered the one thing that made everything else effortless.</p>
        
        <img src="assets/angle-02-hero.png" alt="280 to 180 pounds transformation" class="hero-image">
        
        <h2>The Problem Wasn't Lack of Knowledge</h2>
        
        <p>I had it all figured out.</p>
        
        <p>The meal plans. The workout routines. The right gym membership. Even a personal trainer.</p>
        
        <p>I knew <em>exactly</em> what to do to lose weight.</p>
        
        <p>And for a while, I'd do it. I'd eat clean. Hit the gym. See progress.</p>
        
        <p>Then... I'd stop.</p>
        
        <p>Two steps forward. Three steps back.</p>
        
        <p>Every. Single. Time.</p>
        
        <p>At 280 pounds, staring at myself in the mirror, I realized something terrifying:</p>
        
        <p><span class="highlight">I was losing trust in myself.</span></p>
        
        <p>Not because I didn't know what to do.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Because I couldn't make myself do it.</strong></p>
        
        <h2>The Myth of "Just Have More Discipline"</h2>
        
        <p>Everyone told me the same thing:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>"You just need to be more disciplined."</li>
            <li>"Stay motivated."</li>
            <li>"Track your macros."</li>
            <li>"Don't give up this time."</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>But here's what nobody tells you:</p>
        
        <p><strong>Discipline doesn't work when you're fighting your own identity.</strong></p>
        
        <p>I could force myself to eat salad for lunch.</p>
        
        <p>But my <em>identity</em> said: "I'm someone who turns to food when I'm stressed."</p>
        
        <p>I could drag myself to the gym.</p>
        
        <p>But my <em>identity</em> said: "I'm not a gym person."</p>
        
        <p>And guess what? Your identity always wins.</p>
        
        <p>Every. Single. Time.</p>
        
        <img src="assets/angle-02-frustrated.png" alt="Frustrated with yo-yo dieting" class="hero-image">
        
        <h2>The Moment Everything Changed</h2>
        
        <p>After years of yo-yo dieting, I stumbled onto something that changed everything.</p>
        
        <p>Not a new diet. Not a new workout plan.</p>
        
        <p>A simple truth:</p>
        
        <div class="testimonial">
            <p>"You don't become disciplined and then lose weight. You feel like a fit person, become that identity, and then discipline becomes automatic."</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>I kept hearing people say: <em>"You need to shift your identity."</em></p>
        
        <p>But HOW?</p>
        
        <p>That part always felt vague. Mystical. Out of reach.</p>
        
        <p>Until I discovered the answer:</p>
        
        <p><strong>Feelings first.</strong></p>
        
        <p>I had to <em>feel</em> like a fit person FIRST—not after losing the weight.</p>
        
        <p>Not visualize it. Not think about it.</p>
        
        <p><span class="highlight">Actually FEEL it.</span></p>
        
        <h2>How I Became Someone Who Loves Fitness</h2>
        
        <p>Here's what most people miss:</p>
        
        <p>The actions don't create the identity.</p>
        
        <p><strong>The identity creates the actions.</strong></p>
        
        <p>I didn't force myself to enjoy healthy food.</p>
        
        <p>I became someone for whom healthy food was natural—and <em>then</em> I enjoyed it.</p>
        
        <p>I didn't grind through workouts.</p>
        
        <p>I became someone who loved caring for my body—and <em>then</em> workouts became fun.</p>
        
        <p>The shift happened when I stopped focusing on what I <strong>wanted</strong> and started embodying the <strong>identity</strong> of someone who already had it.</p>
        
        <p>Because here's the truth:</p>
        
        <p><em>The more you focus on what you want, the more you reinforce that you don't have it.</em></p>
        
        <p>You're programming yourself for LACK.</p>
        
        <p>But when you shift into the <em>feeling</em> of already being that person?</p>
        
        <p><strong>Everything changes.</strong></p>
        
        <img src="assets/angle-02-transformation.png" alt="Confident and healthy" class="hero-image">
        
        <h2>The ASKING Framework: How It Works</h2>
        
        <p>The system I used isn't complicated.</p>
        
        <p>It's called the <strong>ASKING framework</strong>, and it's designed to reprogram your subconscious through feelings—not force.</p>
        
        <img src="assets/angle-02-asking-framework.png" alt="ASKING Framework" class="framework-image hero-image">
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>A - Awareness:</strong> Notice what feelings are driving your current habits</li>
            <li><strong>S - Sensations:</strong> Feel where those emotions live in your body</li>
            <li><strong>K - Knowing:</strong> Get clear on the identity you want to embody</li>
            <li><strong>I - Imagine:</strong> Step into that identity fully—see it, feel it, breathe it</li>
            <li><strong>N - Nurture:</strong> Sit with that feeling for 3 minutes</li>
            <li><strong>G - Generate:</strong> Let that new identity reshape your reality</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>I did this for <strong>3 minutes</strong> every night before bed.</p>
        
        <p>Then <strong>3 minutes</strong> in the morning.</p>
        
        <p>And <strong>30 seconds</strong> of reflection throughout the day.</p>
        
        <p>That's it.</p>
        
        <p>No willpower. No white-knuckling. No forcing myself to eat food I hated.</p>
        
        <p><span class="highlight">Just a simple practice that reprogrammed my subconscious to match the identity I wanted.</span></p>
        
        <p>And once my subconscious believed it?</p>
        
        <p><strong>The actions became effortless.</strong></p>

        <h2>The Results: 280 → 180 Pounds</h2>
        
        <p>I didn't diet my way to 180 pounds.</p>
        
        <p><strong>I became someone for whom 180 pounds was natural.</strong></p>
        
        <p>Here's what changed:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>✅ 100 pounds lost (280 → 180)</li>
            <li>✅ No more yo-yo dieting</li>
            <li>✅ No more losing trust in myself</li>
            <li>✅ I <em>enjoy</em> healthy eating now</li>
            <li>✅ I <em>love</em> going to the gym</li>
            <li>✅ Fitness feels natural, not forced</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>But here's what matters more than the numbers:</p>
        
        <p><strong>I'm not fighting myself anymore.</strong></p>
        
        <p>I'm not forcing discipline.</p>
        
        <p>I'm not gritting my teeth through another meal plan.</p>
        
        <p><em>I'm just being myself.</em></p>
        
        <p>And myself happens to be someone who's fit, healthy, and energized.</p>
        
        <h2>Why Every Diet You've Tried Has Failed</h2>
        
        <p>Let me guess:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>You've tried keto, paleo, intermittent fasting, macro tracking...</li>
            <li>You've joined gyms, hired trainers, bought workout plans...</li>
            <li>You've lost weight before—but it always comes back...</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Here's why:</p>
        
        <p><span class="highlight">You were trying to change your behavior without changing your identity.</span></p>
        
        <p>It's like trying to speak a new language by memorizing phrases without understanding grammar.</p>
        
        <p>You might get a few sentences right. But you'll never be fluent.</p>
        
        <p>The ASKING framework teaches you the <em>grammar</em> of transformation.</p>
        
        <p>Once you understand how your subconscious actually works—and how to reprogram it through feelings—weight loss stops being a battle.</p>
        
        <p><strong>It becomes inevitable.</strong></p>

        <h2>Still Not Sure?</h2>
        
        <p>That's okay. Here's the truth:</p>
        
        <p>You don't need another diet plan.</p>
        
        <p>You don't need more motivation.</p>
        
        <p>You don't need to "try harder."</p>
        
        <p>What you need is to understand how your subconscious actually works—and how to speak its language.</p>
        
        <p>Once you do that, weight loss stops being something you <em>force.</em></p>

        <p style="text-align: center;">Dominic Coryell is a former growth lead at Facebook and Shopify who spent years battling weight issues before discovering the "identity-first" approach that changed everything. He lost 100 pounds (280 → 180) without another failed diet—and now helps high-achievers reprogram their subconscious so transformation feels effortless, not forced.</p>
