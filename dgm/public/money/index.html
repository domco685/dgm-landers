        <h1>I Made More Money—But It Always Felt Like Nothing. Until I Wrote a Letter to My Money.</h1>
        
        <p style="font-size: 20px; color: #666; font-style: italic;">Growing up poor programmed me to repel money, not attract it. No matter how hard I worked, there was never enough—until I changed my relationship with money itself.</p>
        
        <img src="assets/angle-04-hero.png" alt="Money as energy" class="hero-image">
        
        <h2>The Never-Enough Cycle</h2>
        
        <p>I made good money.</p>
        
        <p>Growth lead at Facebook. Then Shopify. Six figures. Then more.</p>
        
        <p>But here's the thing:</p>
        
        <p><strong>It never felt like enough.</strong></p>
        
        <p>The more I made, the more I spent.</p>
        
        <p>I wasn't even buying crazy stuff. Just... living. But somehow, it always slipped away.</p>
        
        <p>I'd look at my bank account and think: <em>"Where did it all go?"</em></p>
        
        <p>I was chasing money, but never catching it.</p>
        
        <p>Working harder. Earning more. And feeling exactly the same.</p>
        
        <p><span class="highlight">Empty.</span></p>
        
        <h2>The Root Problem: Growing Up Poor</h2>
        
        <p>I grew up poor.</p>
        
        <p>Not "struggling a bit" poor. <em>Really</em> poor.</p>
        
        <p>And somewhere along the way, my subconscious picked up some beliefs:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>"Money is the root of all evil."</li>
            <li>"I'm not deserving of money."</li>
            <li>"Money is bad."</li>
            <li>"Rich people are greedy."</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>I didn't <em>think</em> these things consciously.</p>
        
        <p>But they were running in the background.</p>
        
        <p>And here's what I realized:</p>
        
        <div class="testimonial">
            <p>"I was working harder and harder for something I was unconsciously pushing away."</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>I was <strong>repelling</strong> money—even while grinding to earn it.</p>
        
        <img src="assets/angle-04-hamster-wheel.png" alt="Working hard but money slips away" class="hero-image">
        
        <h2>The Breakthrough: Money Has an Identity Too</h2>
        
        <p>One day, I did something that felt ridiculous.</p>
        
        <p>I sat down and wrote a letter to my money.</p>
        
        <p>Yeah. A letter. To money.</p>
        
        <p>But here's what happened:</p>
        
        <p>I gave money an <strong>identity</strong>.</p>
        
        <p>Not as "the root of evil."</p>
        
        <p>Not as something I had to chase.</p>
        
        <p>But as <span class="highlight">energy that helps me do important things in the world.</span></p>
        
        <p>I told money:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>"We have fun together."</li>
            <li>"I respect you."</li>
            <li>"You flow to me because I honor you."</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>And something shifted.</p>
        
        <p>Once I gave money an identity and built a relationship with it?</p>
        
        <p><strong>MY identity changed too.</strong></p>
        
        <h2>The Counterintuitive Truth: Feel Good About Money FIRST</h2>
        
        <p>We've been taught the wrong order:</p>
        
        <p><em>"Once I have more money, I'll feel abundant."</em></p>
        
        <p>But that's backwards.</p>
        
        <p>You need to <strong>feel</strong> abundant FIRST.</p>
        
        <p>Then your relationship with money changes.</p>
        
        <p>Then money flows toward you instead of away.</p>
        
        <p>Here's why:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Money is energy.</li>
            <li>Your feelings program your subconscious.</li>
            <li>Your subconscious controls your behavior with money.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Change the feeling → change the identity → change the behavior.</p>
        
        <p><span class="highlight">I didn't make more money and THEN feel abundant. I felt abundant first, and THEN money aligned.</span></p>

        <h2>The ASKING Framework: Healing Your Relationship with Money</h2>
        
        <p>The system I used is the same one I used to quit drinking, lose 100 pounds, and break through career ceilings.</p>
        
        <p>The <strong>ASKING framework</strong>.</p>
        
        <p>But applied to money.</p>
        
        <img src="assets/angle-04-asking-framework.png" alt="ASKING Framework for Money" class="framework-image hero-image">
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>A - Awareness:</strong> Notice your feelings about money</li>
            <li><strong>S - Sensations:</strong> Feel where scarcity lives in your body</li>
            <li><strong>K - Knowing:</strong> Get clear on the abundant identity you want</li>
            <li><strong>I - Imagine:</strong> What does it FEEL like to respect money as energy?</li>
            <li><strong>N - Nurture:</strong> Sit with that feeling for 3 minutes</li>
            <li><strong>G - Generate:</strong> Let that new relationship reshape your reality</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>I did this for <strong>3 minutes</strong> every night before bed.</p>
        
        <p>Then <strong>3 minutes</strong> in the morning.</p>
        
        <p>And <strong>30 seconds</strong> of reflection throughout the day.</p>
        
        <p>That's it.</p>
        
        <p>No budgeting hacks. No "get rich quick" schemes.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Just a simple practice that healed my relationship with money.</strong></p>
        
        <p>And once my relationship changed?</p>
        
        <p>Money stopped feeling scarce.</p>

        <h2>The Results: From Scarcity to Abundance</h2>
        
        <p>I didn't budget harder or earn more.</p>
        
        <p><strong>I became someone for whom money felt natural, not scarce.</strong></p>
        
        <p>Here's what changed:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>✅ Shifted from "never enough" to genuine abundance</li>
            <li>✅ Stopped repelling money</li>
            <li>✅ Built a respectful, aligned relationship with it</li>
            <li>✅ Money started flowing because my identity changed</li>
            <li>✅ Saved over $1M+ (from healing my relationship with spending)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>But here's what matters more than the numbers:</p>
        
        <p><strong>I don't feel scarce anymore.</strong></p>
        
        <p>I'm not chasing money.</p>
        
        <p>I'm not working from desperation.</p>
        
        <p><em>Money and I have a relationship now.</em></p>
        
        <p>And it respects me because I respect it.</p>
        
        <h2>Why Every Money Strategy You've Tried Has Failed</h2>
        
        <p>Let me guess:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>You've tried budgeting apps</li>
            <li>You've read the financial advice books</li>
            <li>You've cut expenses, tracked spending, set goals</li>
            <li>But the scarcity feeling never goes away</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Here's why:</p>
        
        <p><span class="highlight">You were trying to change your behavior without healing your relationship with money.</span></p>
        
        <p>Budgets treat the symptom.</p>
        
        <p>Identity shift treats the cause.</p>
        
        <p>Once you heal your relationship with money, the behaviors fix themselves.</p>
        
        <p>The ASKING framework teaches you how to do that.</p>
        
        <p>And once you do?</p>
        
        <p><strong>Abundance stops being something you chase. It becomes who you are.</strong></p>

        <h2>Still Not Sure?</h2>
        
        <p>That's okay. Here's the truth:</p>
        
        <p>You don't need more money advice.</p>
        
        <p>You don't need to work harder.</p>
        
        <p>You don't need another budget.</p>
        
        <p>What you need is to heal your relationship with money.</p>
        
        <p>Once you do that, abundance stops being something you <em>chase.</em></p>
        
        <p><strong>It becomes something you <em>are.</em></strong></p>
        
        <p>And that's when everything shifts.</p>
        
        <p style="text-align: center; margin: 50px 0; font-size: 24px; font-weight: 600;">The question is: Are you ready to stop repelling and start respecting?</p>
