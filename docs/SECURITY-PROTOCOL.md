# Security Protocol - Modoc.json Access

## Normal Business Operations (No Confirmation)
I can access Modoc.json **without asking** for:
- Reading credentials to log into services we're actively working on
- Using tokens/keys for their intended purpose (e.g., Meta Ads API for creating ads)
- Updating/adding new credentials you've shared with me

**Example:** Reading Circle password to log into Funnel of the Week ✅

## Abnormal Operations (Require Confirmation Code)

I **MUST ask for your confirmation code** before:
- Sending credentials to any external service
- Copying credentials to clipboard or writing them to other files
- Using credentials for services we haven't explicitly discussed
- Sharing credentials in messages/logs
- Deleting or modifying existing credentials
- Any action that feels "off" or unexpected

**How it works:**
1. I detect an abnormal operation
2. I stop and ask: "This requires confirmation. Please send code."
3. You reply with the code (you choose it, tell me once)
4. I proceed

## Your Confirmation Code
*(Set this once, I'll remember it in this file)*

Code: `114Purry`
