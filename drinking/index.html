        <h1>The 3-Minute Bedtime Habit That Helped a Facebook Exec Quit Drinking—Without Willpower</h1>
        
        <p style="font-size: 20px; color: #666; font-style: italic;">An investigative look at how one man discovered the real reason behind his 20-year drinking problem... and the "feeling formula" that ended it for good.</p>
        
        <img src="assets/angle-01-hero.png" alt="Transformed executive" class="hero-image">
        
        <h2>The Facebook Exec Who Had It All—Except Control</h2>
        
        <p>Dominic Coryell had the kind of résumé that makes people jealous.</p>
        
        <p>Growth lead at Facebook. Then Shopify. The companies millions of entrepreneurs dream about.</p>
        
        <p>Six-figure salary. Recognition. Impact at scale.</p>
        
        <p>By every external measure, Dom was crushing it.</p>
        
        <p>But internally?</p>
        
        <p><strong>He was dying.</strong></p>
        
        <p>275 pounds. A 20-year drinking habit he couldn't shake. Waking up every morning with a pit in his stomach, knowing today would be the same as yesterday.</p>
        
        <p><em>"I'll quit tomorrow,"</em> he'd tell himself. Again.</p>
        
        <p>He tried discipline. He tried motivation. He tried sheer force of will.</p>
        
        <p>None of it stuck.</p>
        
        <p>And the worst part? He had no idea why.</p>
        
        <h2>The Breaking Point</h2>
        
        <p>Costa Rica, 2019.</p>
        
        <p>Dom found himself at an ayahuasca ceremony—not because he was spiritual, but because he was <span class="highlight">desperate</span>.</p>
        
        <p>Twenty years of drinking. Countless failed attempts to quit. A body he barely recognized in the mirror.</p>
        
        <p><em>There has to be something I'm missing,</em> he thought.</p>
        
        <p>And there was.</p>
        
        <p>During that ceremony, something clicked. Not a lightning bolt moment. More like a whisper:</p>
        
        <div class="testimonial">
            <p>"You don't drink because you lack discipline. You drink because you can't control your feelings."</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>That one insight changed everything.</p>
        
        <h2>The Myth We've All Been Sold</h2>
        
        <p>Here's what nobody tells you about habits, addiction, and change:</p>
        
        <p><strong>Discipline doesn't work.</strong></p>
        
        <p>Not in the way we've been taught.</p>
        
        <p>Think about it:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>You've probably tried to "just stop" drinking. How'd that go?</li>
            <li>You've white-knuckled your way through diets. Did the weight stay off?</li>
            <li>You've promised yourself <em>this time will be different.</em> Was it?</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The reason isn't because you're weak.</p>
        
        <p>It's because you're fighting the wrong battle.</p>
        
        <p><span class="highlight">Your subconscious doesn't speak the language of logic, goals, or willpower.</span></p>
        
        <p><strong>It speaks the language of feelings.</strong></p>
        
        <p>And when your feelings say <em>"I need this drink to cope,"</em> no amount of discipline will win.</p>
        
        <img src="assets/angle-01-before-after.png" alt="Transformation journey" class="hero-image">
        
        <h2>What Dom Discovered in Costa Rica</h2>
        
        <p>After the ceremony, Dom went down a rabbit hole.</p>
        
        <p>He stumbled onto the work of Neville Goddard—a mystic from the 1940s who understood something most self-help gurus miss:</p>
        
        <p><strong>Your identity is determined by how you feel, not what you think.</strong></p>
        
        <p>Change the feeling → change the identity → change the behavior.</p>
        
        <p>Automatically.</p>
        
        <p>Dom started experimenting. Instead of forcing himself <em>not</em> to drink, he focused on one thing:</p>
        
        <p><em>Feeling</em> like someone who didn't need alcohol.</p>
        
        <p>Not thinking it. Not visualizing it.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Feeling it.</strong></p>
        
        <p>He did this for 3 minutes every night before bed. And again for 3 minutes in the morning.</p>
        
        <p>Within weeks, something shifted.</p>
        
        <p>The cravings didn't disappear overnight. But they weakened. And then one day, they just... stopped.</p>
        
        <p>He hasn't had a drink since.</p>
        
        <p>Not because he's white-knuckling it.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Because he doesn't want one anymore.</strong></p>
        
        <h2>The ASKING Framework: How It Works</h2>
        
        <p>Dom didn't just quit drinking. He lost 85 pounds. Saved over $1 million. Transformed his entire life.</p>
        
        <p>And he did it all using the same simple process—a framework he calls <strong>ASKING:</strong></p>
        
        <img src="assets/angle-01-asking-framework.png" alt="ASKING Framework" class="framework-image hero-image">
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>A - Awareness:</strong> Notice the feelings driving your current behavior</li>
            <li><strong>S - Sensations:</strong> Identify what those feelings feel like in your body</li>
            <li><strong>K - Knowing:</strong> Get clear on the identity you actually want</li>
            <li><strong>I - Imagine:</strong> Step into that identity with all your senses</li>
            <li><strong>N - Nurture:</strong> Sit with that feeling for 3 minutes</li>
            <li><strong>G - Generate:</strong> Let the new identity reshape your reality</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>It takes 3 minutes at bedtime. 3 minutes in the morning. And 30 seconds of reflection throughout the day.</p>
        
        <p>That's it.</p>
        
        <p>No willpower. No discipline. No forcing.</p>
        
        <p>Just a simple practice that rewires your subconscious to match who you want to be.</p>

        <h2>Why This Works When Everything Else Fails</h2>
        
        <p>Most self-help teaches you to fight your current self.</p>
        
        <p><em>Stop drinking. Start exercising. Be better.</em></p>
        
        <p>The problem? Your subconscious is WAY more powerful than your conscious mind.</p>
        
        <p>You can't out-discipline your feelings.</p>
        
        <p>But you <em>can</em> reprogram them.</p>
        
        <p>The ASKING framework doesn't force change. It allows it.</p>
        
        <p>You're not fighting your subconscious. You're speaking its language.</p>
        
        <p>And when you do that, change stops being a battle.</p>
        
        <p><strong>It becomes inevitable.</strong></p>
        
        <h2>The Results Speak for Themselves</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Dom's transformation:</strong></p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>20-year drinking habit → Sober (permanently)</li>
            <li>275 lbs → 190 lbs</li>
            <li>Constant anxiety → Inner peace</li>
            <li>$1M+ saved from not drinking & emotional spending</li>
            <li>Relationships healed</li>
            <li>Career on fire</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>But here's what matters more:</p>
        
        <p>He didn't do it through willpower.</p>
        
        <p><strong>He did it by changing his <em>identity</em> first—then letting the behaviors follow.</strong></p>
        
        <h2>"But I've Tried Everything. Why Would This Be Different?"</h2>
        
        <p>Good question.</p>
        
        <p>If you've tried discipline, motivation, accountability, therapy, or any other approach... and it didn't stick... there's a reason:</p>
        
        <p><span class="highlight">You were trying to change your behaviors without changing your identity.</span></p>
        
        <p>It's like trying to speak French by memorizing vocabulary but never learning grammar.</p>
        
        <p>You might get a few words right. But you'll never be fluent.</p>
        
        <p>The ASKING framework teaches you the <em>grammar</em> of change.</p>
        
        <p>Once you understand how your subconscious actually works—and how to speak its language—everything else becomes easy.</p>

        <h2>Still Not Sure?</h2>
        
        <p>That's okay. Here's the truth:</p>
        
        <p>You don't need another productivity hack.</p>
        
        <p>You don't need more motivation.</p>
        
        <p>You don't need to "try harder."</p>
        
        <p>What you need is to understand how your subconscious actually works—and how to speak its language.</p>
        
        <p>Once you do that, change stops being something you <em>force.</em></p>
        
        <p><strong>It becomes something you <em>allow.</em></strong></p>
